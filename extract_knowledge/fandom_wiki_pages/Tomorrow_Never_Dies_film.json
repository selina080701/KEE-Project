It was released in 1997, by producers [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]], and was also the first Bond film made after the death of veteran producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]]. The film is dedicated to his memory, and beginning with this production and in each subsequent Bond film, the first credit reads: \"Albert R. Broccoli's EON Productions Limited presents...\"; the word \"Limited\" was removed in the later films.",
    "Plot Summary": "===Russian Border and South China Sea===\nThe film begins at a [[terrorist arms bazaar]] somewhere on the [[Russia]]n border. [[MI6]], with Russian permission, has sent [[James Bond (Pierce Brosnan)|James Bond]] near the arms bazar to survey trades and purchases by the terrorists. 007 has set up cameras and one terrorist named [[Satoshi Isagura]] is identified. Another, [[Henry Gupta]], is spotted with a stolen [[United States|American]] GPS encoder. Upon viewing the range of arms, and over [[M (Judi Dench) (classic film continuity)|M]]'s objections that the [[00 Agents|00 Agent]] has not completed his reconnaissance, [[Admiral Roebuck]] orders a missile strike upon the position. However, it later transpires that the terrorists have a [[Soviet]] military jet with two nuclear torpedoes. Realizing the missile strike could detonate the torpedoes or at least cause an environmental disaster, M demands the launched missile be aborted, but it is out of range of the [[HMS Chester|launching ship]]'s signals. Bond, using diversionary tactics, steals the plane with the torpedoes and escapes the missile strike as does Gupta with the GPS encoder.\n\nThe encoder is later used by corrupt media mogul [[Elliot Carver]] as an attempt to provoke conflict between the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as method to gain broadcasting rights in China. The encoder is used to send a British frigate, the ''[[HMS Devonshire]]'', off course in the South China Sea where Carver's own [[Stealth Ship|stealth ship]],  sinks it while also shooting down a Chinese fighter plane. When the survivors of the sunken frigate are found to have been killed using Chinese ammunition, a [[Royal Navy]] task group is sent to the region.\n\n===Hamburg===\nAs tensions between the two countries mount, Bond is sent by M to investigate Carver after MI6 identifies a spurious signal sent from one of Carver's [[CMGM satellite|communications satellites]] at the time the warship was sunk. During the investigation, Bond seduces Carver's wife, his old flame [[Paris Carver]] and as a result of which her husband orders her death. Meanwhile, Bond encounters Chinese secret agent [[Wai Lin]] while investigating the [[CMGN Hamburg Printing Factory]]. Bond fights off Carver's men, drives off his new car and finally crashes it in an auto shop.\n\n===South China Sea===\nBond meets his old CIA ally [[Jack Wade]] and a GPS expert. The scientist tells them that the encounter was tampered with and Bond request Wade to use US military gear so he can perform a HALO jump near the sunken frigate. Greenwalt, the expert, finally identifies the Royal Navy ship sunk in Vietnamese waters. As Bond finds a missile missing from the frigate, he encounters Wai Lin again. The pair however are captured by Stamper, Carver's right-hand thug as they surface.\n\n===Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City)===\n[[File:Let_him_rip.jpg|thumb|Bond and Wai-Lin escape Carver in Saigon.]]\nThey are taken to Carver's headquarters in Saigon. The media mogul reveals his plan, stating he will attack Beijing and General Chang will take over the government. He then remarks that Bond and Wai Lin will get tortured by Stamper. Bond and Wai Lin manage to escape and after a furious chase across the city, they take a shower. Wai Lin, not  trusting the SIS agent, handcuffs him to a pipe and runs to a MSS safehouse. There, she fights off several thugs sent by General Chang, Carver's Chinese colleague. Bond saves her life and and she works on a computer to find Carver's ship while Bond finds weapons and gadgets made by the MSS so he and Wal Lin can end this.\n\n===Finding and Destroying Carver's ship===\nThe two plant explosives on the exterior hull, however, Wai Lin is spotted and captured. Bond fights off Stamper's men then plants a grenade secured in a glass jar inside. He holds Gupta hostage and tells Carver he wants to make a trade: Gupta for Wai Lin. However, a deadly fight ensues. As Bond's clever explosive detonates to start the battle, HMS Bedford spots it on its radar and the Admiral of the taskforce orders it to be shelled -- the radar signal is too weak for a missile launch. Carver orders his ship to increase speed, which results in it to sail faster than the Bedford. Wai Lin heads to the engine room and manages to destroy all systems, however, Stamper captures her once again. Bond ultimately kills Carver with his own Sea Drill and while he attempts to destroy the stolen missile, Stamper reveals a chained up Wai Lin and lowers her into the water. The villain assaults Bond, seeking revenge for Dr. Kaufman and Stamper though eventually Bond manages to kill him with the blast of the missile. Bond saves Wai Lin and Bedford searches for them though Bond tells his Chinese ally to ignore it.",

These pre-1995 stories were conceived primarily with actor [[Timothy Dalton]] as James Bond in mind, had he remained in the role.\n\nOne of these is the ''\"[[Unmade \"Reunion With Death\" (1993)|Reunion With Death]]\"'', which was written by [[Richard Smith]], dated December 1993. Its story would have taken place in [[Japan]], when Bond is sent to investigate a Japanese industrialist who is also a Yakuza boss, being suspected of ordering a hit on the British industrialist Sir Robert Grey, who was M's dear friend. The plot would have featured Bond teaming up with [[Tiger Tanaka]]'s children, and the Bond girl would have been the villain's wife, with Bond's chemistry with her being similar to that between Bond and Paris Carver in the completed Tomorrow Never Dies. \n\nThe ''Reunion With Death'' was not pursued further, as Dalton's contract with EON had expired and he refused to renew it. While the story itself never materialized ''talis qualis'', various ideas from it would be used in the completed 18th Bond film.<ref>Feutry, Clement (2024); page 1250-1256</ref> Other ideas from the script would also be repurposed for later Bond films; such as [[The World Is Not Enough (film)|The World is Not Enough]], [[Quantum of Solace (film)|Quantum of Solace]] and [[Spectre (film)|Spectre]].\n\nAdditionally, [[John Cork]] (founder of ''[[Ian Fleming Foundation]]'') had reportedly submitted 20-30 different drafts, of which none really piqued EON's interest. However, one of them was about using a satellite to mislead a British battleship off course, sink it, and steal its missile(s), which would be used in Tomorrow Never Dies.<ref>Feutry, Clement (2024); page 1257-1259</ref>\n\n====Donald Westlake (1995)====\nDuring the shooting of GoldenEye, [[Wikipedia:Donald E. Westlake|Donald E. Westlake]] was commissioned to write a plot for Bond 18. Around March 29, 1995; Westlake and [[Jeff Kleeman]] were talking about the 18th Bond's plot, which would have featured a hacker villain operating out at a gothic castle (whose plan was to cause an global financial meltdown), Asia location and Bond apparently teaming up with his biological niece named Honey Beevers. However, Kleeman would inform that the \"use of hacking to cause a financial disaster\" proposal was too close to GoldenEye's plot, which was in production already, forcing Westlake to respond with \"Okay, Plan B, Round 2.\"<ref>Feutry, Clement (2024); page 1261-1262</ref>\n\nIn May 1995, Westlake visited the producers in London to talk about the plot. As it the [[Wikipedia:Handover of Hong Kong|Hong Kong handover]] was nearing and the film scheduled for 1997 release, it was deemed that Hong Kong was to serve as a major location. In August 1995, Westlake would submit a 3-page \"villain profile\" of his idea for the main villain - to the producers.<ref>Feutry, Clement (2024); page 1263-1265</ref>\n\nAround September 1995, Westlake started providing fuller scripts. The last incarnations were submitted around October 1995. The general plot in these was Bond going to Australia and Hong Kong to face with an obese, Chinese-born American construction CEO (named Gideon Goodbread early on, and later named Devlin Frey). The villain's scheme is to steal gold from a Hong Kong bank/gold reserve with use of tunnels that his construction companies have made -- including using \"submarine drills\" to ground the gold into dust to make it easier to carry. After extraction is complete, they then fill those tunnels with seawater, which causes [[Wikipedia: Solvation|solvation]] that results in extreme [[Wikipedia:Land subsidence|land subsidence]] that will destroy all urban settlements in [[Wikipedia:Hong Kong Island|Hong Kong Island]].\n\nAfter the release of GoldenEye in November 1995, Westlake was let go of the project. Following the release of Tomorrow Never Dies, Westlake had turned his unused scripts into a book, removing all elements that may have had legitimately run afoul with James Bond copyrights. He initially attempted to release it circa August 1998 under the name '''\"Fall of a City\"''', but was unable to do so, with him being unable to get the book published during his lifetime. After Westlake passed away in 2008, the ''Hard Castle Crime'' book publisher decided to publish the book in 2017 (19-20 years after Tomorrow Never Dies was released) under the name [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32303196-forever-and-a-death '''\"Forever and a Death.\"]''' The 2017 book was trimmed down from 610-page manuscript to 433.<ref>Feutry, Clement (2024); page 1280-1285</ref>\n\n====Feirstein Round 1 (1996)====\nAfterwards, [[Bruce Feirstein]] was assigned to write the 18th Bond, having proven his worth in writing GoldenEye's final incarnation. Feirstein already go the idea for media mogul villain while working on GoldenEye. He would submit his first 16-page \"Bond 18\" treatment in May 1996. Before further script revisions, the series producer [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli]] passed away -- on June 27, 1996.\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to Pierce Brosnan in an interview published in the December 2005 issue of Playboy, [[Monica Bellucci]] tested for the role of Paris Carver. Daphne Deckers, who portrays the PR Lady, later confirmed this at the premiere of [[Spectre (film)|''Spectre'']] in Amsterdam. She saw Bellucci the same day she herself auditioned.

However, a few days after she got the part, Hatcher found out she was pregnant and her scenes had to be filmed quickly.\n\nAnthony Hopkins - who had been asked to be the villain [[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]] (and presumably the [[Unmade Bond 17 (1991)|Unmade Bond 17]] as well) - was asked for the part of Elliot Carver. Although he was apparently aboard at first, the confusion resulting from the production chaos caused him to drop out within three days, forcing EON to look for a replacement. Hopkins would instead go to star in 1998's Mask of Zorro, which was directed by [[Martin Campbell]], who had directed GoldenEye, the Bond movie preceding Tomorrow Never Dies.\n\n===Filming===\nTomorrow Never Dies marked a first time in 10 years to have its to have the entire productions being worked in [[Pinewood Studios]], with the previous one being the 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights (film)|The Living Daylights]]''.<ref>[http://commanderbond.net/Public/Stories/2866-1.shtml]</ref>\n\nWhen filming began, the script wasn't actually finished.

However, a few days after she got the part, Hatcher found out she was pregnant and her scenes had to be filmed quickly.\n\nAnthony Hopkins - who had been asked to be the villain [[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]] (and presumably the [[Unmade Bond 17 (1991)|Unmade Bond 17]] as well) - was asked for the part of Elliot Carver. Although he was apparently aboard at first, the confusion resulting from the production chaos caused him to drop out within three days, forcing EON to look for a replacement. Hopkins would instead go to star in 1998's Mask of Zorro, which was directed by [[Martin Campbell]], who had directed GoldenEye, the Bond movie preceding Tomorrow Never Dies.",

    "Pre-release and marketing": "A March 10, 1997 report in the New York Daily News on the production of the as-yet untitled film (then being referred to as ''Bond 18'') indicated that several titles were being considered for the film, including: ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3781492/ Shamelady]'', ''Avatar'', ''Shatterhand'', ''Zero Windchill'' and the title considered most likely &mdash; ''Tomorrow Never Dies''.[http://commanderbond.net/Public/Stories/2866-1.shtml] The rumored title ''Shatterhand'' is interesting as this is the alias used by [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Literary)|Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] in Ian Fleming's original novel of ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'' which, like ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', also has strong oriental ties.\n\nIn conjunction with the release of the film in 1997, BMW offered a special promotion where the model 750i sedan and the R1200 cruiser motorcycle could be purchased for $149,000 CAD.",

    "Reception and legacy": "Tomorrow Never Dies is peculiar in that it's reception has improved over the years. Despite its solid box-office performance - especially as it was released on the same timeframe as the box-office smash hit Titanic, the film itself was received quite lukewarmly at release. Even though there were critics who found the satirical edge of Elliot Carver a refreshing addition, others found its media mogul villain too far-fetched. However, in the 2010s with the increased awareness of deceitful media practices and how information and disinformation travels in the internet, the once absurd Carver is now considered with new eyes of credibility; even if Carver's use of newspaper media being now considered somewhat dated.",
    "Trivia": "* Upon seeing a several stories-tall images of Elliot Carver adorning his skyscraper, Bond remarks that Carver, \"...appears to have developed an edifice complex.\" This line makes a play on the well-known \"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex Oedipus complex]\" phrase, but the proper diagnosis for someone like Carver would be having a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder Narcissus] complex, an extreme personality disorder of which intense self-worship and undue self-esteem are the primary symptoms.\n* The film was adapted into a [[Tomorrow Never Dies (video game)|video game]] released for the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console) Sony PlayStation] in 1999. Unlike the previous title [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 game)|''GoldenEye 007'']] for the Nintendo 64, it is a 3rd-Person Shooter game instead of 1st. It did not quite receive as much acclaim among fans.\n* It has been suggested that the character of Elliot Carver is (very loosely) based on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch Rupert Murdoch], whose [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corp News Corporation] exerts power across many continents, and to some degree, Charles Foster Kane (portrayed by [[Orson Welles]]) from ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane Citizen Kane]'', not to mention media magnate [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Turner Ted Turner].\n* A business report from one of Carver's executives about \"releasing software full of bugs which will force users to upgrade for years\" is a shot against Microsoft and co-founder Bill Gates.\n*During the Carver Satellite launching party scene, a jazz instrumental of the 1924 song \"It Had to Be You\" could be briefly heard. Coincidentally, the song's title corresponds with James Bond's reunion with Paris Carver after a long while.\n*The film was originally titled ''Tomorrow Never Lies'', a reference to Elliott Carver's newspaper ''Tomorrow''. However, it was then the subject of a typo and the producers liked the alternate title so much they adopted it.\n*This was the final Bond film-to-date to be released directly through [[United Artists]]; parent company [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] would assume co-production and distribution beginning with the next film.\n*This is the first James Bond film of which both the title and the main storyline completely have no relations to the life and previous works of ''Bond'' creator [[Ian Fleming]]. The only link to previous Bond works in this film is, en route to the final battle, Bond and Wai Lin pass the Phang Nga Bay Island, which was previously set as the hideout of [[Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee)|Francisco Scaramanga]] in [[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|''The Man with the Golden Gun'']], but this location featured in none of Fleming's original novels or short stories.\n*Several inconsistencies exist in the representation of the [[Royal Navy]]. Type 23 frigates do not carry land attack cruise missiles as depicted in the first moments of the film; the missile that is fired is fitted to Type 23s but is the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpoon_(missile) Harpoon] anti-shipping missile. The encounter with the stealth ship is also of poetic licence as lookouts would be posted on deck, in the real world an aircraft carrier would also have been present in the task group, and a wealth of options to engage the stealth ship would have been open to the task group commander. (This stems from only one ship model being built for the movie to save costs and time.) Rather than shelling the stealth ship, he could have also used a helicopter, both systems being carried by Type 23 frigates.\n**The Harpoon launch footage described above was used again in ''[[Die Another Day]]'' as a supposed anti-satellite missile launch.\n*This is the first Bond film where Bond switches to the newer [[Walther P99]] until [[Daniel Craig]] appeared and reverted to the iconic [[Walther PPK]] in the  pre-credit scenes.\n*Paris Carver asks, \"Tell me, James, do you still sleep with a gun under your pillow?\" is a not to the original [[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale novel]]. This would be referenced again in ''[[Die Another Day (film)|Die Another Day]]'', in which the same thing also gets Bond in trouble in that film.\n* The Phang Nga filming location in Thailand was substituted for Ha Long Bay as named in the film. That location was previously film for [[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|''The Man with the Golden Gun'']]. Today, it is famously known as [https://www.phuket101.net/james-bond-island/ James Bond Island].\n*The third and final Bond film to show Bond in his Royal Navy uniform. Here, he not only has his Commander stripes but the insignia of Fleet Air Arm Aviator (indicating he must have served in the FAA). He also has a Parachutist Badge with wings (which indicating that as a Royal Navy personnel he was awarded as part of a Special Forces parachutist course). Bond's decorations again differ from [[You Only Live Twice (film)|''You Only Live Twice'']] and [[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|''The Spy Who Loved Me'']]. Here they are: Order of the British Empire (OBE), Distinguish Service Cross, Campaign Service Medal (1962), UN Former Republic of Yugoslavia Medal, NATO medal for Former Yugoslavia and, Rhodesia medal. The second row medals could also be the United Nations Medal (UNTSO), South Atlantic Medal.",
