Let us drink to that.|[[James Bond (Roger Moore)|James Bond]] and [[Milos Columbo]]|For Your Eyes Only}}\n'''For Your Eyes Only''' is a 1981 spy film, and the twelfth spy film in the [[James Bond|James Bond series]] as well as the fifth to star [[Roger Moore]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]]. It marked the directorial debut of [[John Glen]], who had worked as editor and second unit director in three other Bond films.\n\nThe screenplay by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Michael G. Wilson]] takes its characters and combines the plots from two short stories from [[Ian Fleming]]'s[[For Your Eyes Only (book)| ''For Your Eyes Only'']] collection: [[For Your Eyes Only (book)#.22For Your Eyes Only.22|the&nbsp;title story]] and \"[[Risico]].\" In the plot, Bond attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek businessmen along with [[Judy Havelock|Melina Havelock]], a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents. Some writing elements were inspired by the novels ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'', ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'' and ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.\n\nAfter the over-the-top, science fiction-focused ''[[Moonraker]]'', the producers wanted a conscious return to the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. ''For Your Eyes Only'' followed a more gritty, realistic approach, and an unusually strong narrative theme of revenge and its consequences. Filming locations included [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[England]], with underwater footage being shot in [[Bahamas|The Bahamas]].\n\n''For Your Eyes Only'' was released on 24 June 1981 initially to a mixed to positive critical reception, though overall in later years have been positively recived; the film was a financial success, generating $195.3 million worldwide. This was the last Bond film to be distributed solely by United Artists; the studio merged with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] soon after this film's release.",
    "Plot summary": "===Pre-titles===\n[[File:007 toys with his nemesis (For Your Eyes Only).png|thumb|right|300px|Bond have trapping Blofeld wheelchair on the copter's landing skid.]]\nOn the 12th anniversary of his wifes death While visiting her grave, [[Tracy Bond (Diana Rigg)|Tracy]], [[James Bond (Roger Moore)|James Bond]] is called back to [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] headquarters. A [[Bell 206 JetRanger|helicopter]] arrives to transport him. As he boards the chopper he notices that the priest who'd given him the message genuflects the sign of the cross.  \n\nDuring the flight [[Helicopter pilot (George Sweeney)|the pilot]] is killed by electricity that surges through his headset and a familiar voice begins to taunt Bond over the chopper's loudspeaker; it is that of [[Blofeld (classic film continuity)|Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], Bond's arch-nemesis, who survived the events of [[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|his last encounter with Bond]] but now wheel-chair bounded and seeking revenge against Bond for dismantling <small>[[SPECTRE]]</small>. As Bond struggles to gain control of the chopper, he notices the man in a motorized wheelchair nearby. Bond manages to reach the pilot's seat but cannot operate the 'copter. Blofeld, controlling the 'copter with a small console, flies the chopper into a giant foundry building, with the intention of letting it crash.\n\nBond realizes that a set of cables have been wired to the chopper and he rips them out, regaining control of it. He flies after Blofeld and hooks his wheelchair on the end of the chopper's landing skid (Blofield cat jumps down and escapes). Blofeld pleads for his life and tries to bargain to be put down on the ground, including offering to buy Bond a \"delicatessen in stainless steel\". A vengeful Bond promises to put Blofield dow---Bond ironically puts Blofield \"down\" a nearby very  tall smokestack, finally killing his nemesis for good and avenging Tracy. Blofeld's last words are \"Mr.BONNNNNNNNNNND\" as he falls to his doom with a large crash.\n\n===Sinking of St. Georges, massacre of Havelocks, Briefing===\n[[File:FYEO - The St Georges explodes.png|thumb|300px|left|The destruction of St. Georges]]\nIn the Adriatic Sea, a disguised [[Malta|Maltese]] fishing ship, the [[St. Georges]], trawls off the coast of Albania. Inside is a hidden control room for British SIGINT and defence. The spy ship is equipped with [[ATAC]] (Automatic Targeting and Attack Communicator), a valuable defensive and offensive device that the [[Soviet Union]] would like to obtain. When the ship's decoy fishing crew hauls in a net, it brings with it an old anti-warship mine which explodes, sinking the St. Georges. \n\nAt MI6, [[M (Bernard Lee)|M]]'s temporary replacement, Chief-of-Staff [[Bill Tanner (James Villiers)|Bill Tanner]], is informed of the incident. When he asks how deep the water is off the coast of Albania, he is told it isn't \"deep enough\" by the [[First Sea Lord]]. Hoping to find the St. Georges and the ATAC discreetly, Tanner orders a British underwater archeologist, [[Timothy Havelock (Jack Hedley)|Tim Havelock]] to find the St. Georges. Meanwhile, Tanner's [[KGB]] counterpart, [[General Gogol|Anatol Gogol]], is told that the ATAC is in play, and instructs an unknown contact to procure it for him.\n\nThe Havelock's daughter, [[Melina Havelock|Melina]], arrives by plane at her father's yacht near the site of the St. Georges' sinking after taking a vacation in [[France]]. While she reunites with her parents [[Cessna A185F|the plane]] she was brought in suddenly strafes the yacht with a burst of machine-gun fire. Both Havelock and [[Iona Havelock|his wife]] are killed. However, Melina is unharmed and mourns her parents' murder with a look of despair and rage on her face.\n\nIn [[London]], James Bond is called into M's office to meet with Tanner and Minister of Defence, [[Fredrick Gray|Sir Fredrick Gray]] after [[Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell)|Miss Moneypenny]] informs Bond that M is on leave. He is ordered to find the ATAC, his first lead being the man, [[Hector Gonzales]], a pilot and Cuban national who killed the Havelocks. Tanner orders Bond to find Gonzales near Madrid and interrogate him for information.\n\n===Gonzales' pool party, Citroën escape===\nBond goes to Gonzales' home where he's throwing a party. Bond observes that Gonzales is meeting with a mysterious man in an elegant suit and octagonal wire-framed glasses, and deduces that he is paying Gonzales for the assassination he performed. Bond is captured by [[Gonzales' Henchman|a security guard]] and brought to Gonzales who identifies him immediately as British Secret Service and orders him taken away. As he dives into his pool, Gonzales is struck and killed by a crossbow arrow fired by an unseen assassin. The distraction allows Bond to escape. The man with wire-frame glasses does not intervene and instead leaves with the money that he intended to pay Gonzales.\n\nAs Bond makes his escape, one of the security guards chasing him is also killed by a crossbow bolt. The shooter is revealed to be Melina Havelock, who has been seeking revenge for the deaths of her parents. Before they can escape in Bond's [[Lotus Esprit]], it explodes when a guard tries to break one of its windows. Bond and Melina use her car, a small, clunky [[Citroën 2CV|Citroën]], in a furious chase where they evade Gonzales' men in a wild chase through a small town and through an orchard.\n\nBack in London, Bond reports back to MI6, where the upset Tanner reprimands him for failing to obtain any information from Gonzales. However, Bond, with [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]]'s assistance, uses a highly sophisticated database called an Identigraph, to identify and locate the man paying off Gonzalez. The man is revealed to be [[Locque|Emile Leopold Locque]], a Belgian assassin who has worked as an enforcer for numerous crime syndicates. The most recent intel suggests he is operating in Cortina d'Ampezzo in northern [[Italy]].\n\n===Cortina===\n[[File:BondMeetsKristatos.png|thumb|300px|left|Bond meeting Kristatos with Luigi Ferrara.]]\nBond travels to Cortina and meets [[Luigi Ferrara]], an Italian Secret Service agent who tells him that Locque may be associated with a man called the White Dove (indicated by the pin Locque and it's members wear). He directs Bond to his most reliable contact in the Greek Underworld, [[Aris Kristatos|Aristotle Kristatos]]. Kristatos identifies the White Dove as [[Milos Columbo]], the kingpin of [[Greece]]'s heroin trade and former business associate and friend of Kristatos. Kristatos asks Bond to be an escort for his young skating protege, [[Bibi Dahl]], while she watches the biathlon. Bibi tries to seduce Bond in his hotel room, but Bond refuses her advances due to her young age.\n\nAt the biathlon, Bibi points out a friend of her's, [[Erich Kriegler]], a competitor in the event. Bond bids Bibi farewell and leaves the event; as he skis away, he is attacked by a small group of killers on winterized motorcycles. One of them is Kriegler himself, who tries to kill Bond with his sniper's rifle, another is Locque. Bond is able to escape his attackers, killing several of them.\n\nBond meets Bibi later at the Olympic skating rink where Bibi is practicing. He asks her about Kriegler and finds out that he is an East German defector. After Bibi leaves, he is again attacked, this time by three hulking hockey players. Bond beats them all and returns to his car. There he finds that Ferrara has been killed. In Ferrara's dead hand is a White Dove pin.\n\nBond goes to the business section of Cortina the next day and spots Melina buying a crossbow. As he approaches her, they are both attacked by men on motorcycles, much like Bond the previous day. Bond kills both attackers and orders Melina to leave Cortina. He also tells her that her need for revenge may get her killed too. She agrees to return to her father's yacht and wait for word from Bond.\n\n===Greece, Columbo and Albania===\nBond travels to Greece to continue his investigation of Columbo. At a nightclub, he meets with Kristatos and asks how to meet Columbo, not knowing that Columbo's men are secretly recording their conversation. Columbo is at the same club and is sitting with a woman, [[Lisl von Schlaf]], a countess. She becomes openly insulted by one of Columbo's comments and proceeds to leave. \n\nSeeing an opportunity to learn more about Columbo, Bond approaches Lisl and offers to have Kristatos' valet, [[Apostis]], drive her back to her hotel. After Apostis leaves, Bond and Lisl spend the night together. Lisl confesses that Columbo knows that Bond is a secret agent, and has asked her to learn more about him. Unbeknownst to either of them, Apostis is secretly listening in on their conversation.\n\nIn the morning, the two walk on the beach and are attacked by Locque and another apparent White Dove's henchman, [[Claus]]. Locque kills Lisl by running her down in his dune buggy, and he and Claus capture Bond. Claus is suddenly shot by a harpoon and several men wearing the White Dove emblem appear out of the surf and capture Bond.\n\n[[File:Got_the_boot.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bond killing Locque]]\nBond is taken to Columbo himself on a yacht, who tries to convince the spy that Kristatos is actually the real enemy and the one behind the search for the ATAC. As a means to prove this, he invites Bond to accompany his men to Albania, where Kristatos is using a shipping warehouse to process heroin. Bond reluctantly agrees, and they find Locque overseeing a shipment of raw opium smuggled in enormous rolls of newsprint. They also discover some old naval mines, implying that the sinking of the St. Georges was no accident. \n\nAs his men provide cover, Locque wires explosives to one of the mines, taking the detonator with him to a nearby escape car. Locque detonates the explosives to cover his escape, but Columbo's raiding party are able to flee the warehouse before it explodes. Using an underground tunnel, Bond is able to get to the shipyard's entrance before Locque does. He opens fire on Locque's car, hitting the assassin in the shoulder and causing him to lose control of the vehicle, which careens off the road. As Locque's car precariously teeters on the precipice of a cliff, Bond shows him the dove pin he'd gotten from Ferrara, throws it to Locque; the tiny shift in weight causes the car to slide off the cliff. Bond gives the car a hard kick and it plummets, killing Locque.\n\n===Diving for ATAC===\n[[File:Gallery-1449070213-for-your-eyes-only.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bond and Melina before they are about to be subjected to Kristatos' boat-tugging torture.]]\nBond travels to the Havelock's yacht and finds Melina. Bond asks Melina if her father possibly left behind any information about his work for the British government. Melina shows Bond her father's journal and they discover that her father had been diving in an unusual underwater location.\n\nThe two go there in her father's mini-submarine and find the St. Georges. The enter the wreck and find the ATAC attached to an explosive charge which had failed to be activated. Bond disarms the bomb and takes the ATAC when the two are attacked by a diver in a JIM suit. Bond manages to escape the killer and attaches the ATAC bomb to the JIM suit, destroying it. Nearly out of breathable air, he and Melina return to the mini-sub but are again attacked by another mini-sub. They are able to escape this man as well.\n\nThey return to the surface to find that Kristatos, accompanied by Kriegler and Apostis, has seized the Havelock yacht and killed the crew. Kristatos takes the ATAC with the intention of selling it to the Soviet government; Kriegler is revealed to be his KGB contact. Using Melina and Bond as \"bait\" they tow them behind Kristatos' yacht hoping that sharks will eat them. Bond is able to snap the line binding them and they retreat to a SCUBA tank Melina left on the ocean floor. Kristatos, assuming Bond and Melina are both dead, leaves.\n\nThe two make it back to their yacht and hear her father's parrot, Max, reveal the destination of the ATAC, a location only called \"[[St. Cyril's Monastery|St. Cyril's]].\" Q informs Bond that there are over 300 locations with the same name in all of Greece, however, Bond knows that Columbo will know where Kristatos has retreated to.\n\n===St. Cyril's===\n[[File:FYEO Melina Columbo Crew StCyril Photo Bondwiki1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Melina, Columbo and his crew observing Bond's climb up to St.Cyril's.]]\nThe St. Cyril's that Columbo knows of is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_the_Holy_Trinity,_Meteora monastery] in the northern mountains of Greece and sits atop a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteora series of sheer cliffs]. It is only accessible on the ground by a cabled basket; Bond must scale the cliff to reach the machinery controlling the basket. As he climbs, he is found by Apostis, who tries to loosen the spikes and climbing rope Bond is using as a safety line. Bond is able to make it up the cliff far enough to throw a spike at Apostis and send him off the cliff. He reaches the basket house and lowers it for the rest of the crew to come up.\n\nGeneral Gogol is on his way to the monastery to collect the ATAC. Kristatos attempts to flee with the ATAC, with Columbo and Melina in hot pursuit. Kriegler attacks Bond, nearly overpowering him, before Bond takes him out with a spiked candelabra and races after Columbo and Melina. Kristatos and Columbo fight. Kristatos knocks Columbo out, only to be cornered by Melina, who seeks to kill him to avenge her parents' death. \n\nWhile Bond and Melina argue over whether to execute Kristatos or simply arrest him, Kristatos pulls a switchblade out of his jacket. Before Kristatos can attack Melina or Bond, Columbo regains consciousness and kills him with a throwing knife. Gogol arrives and genially asks for the ATAC; Bond suddenly throws it over the side of the mountain where it shatters hundreds of feet below. Gogol is visibly shocked at first but Bond replies \"That's Detente, Comrade! You don't have it, I don't have it.\" Gogol suddenly smiles and leaves, obviously humored.\n\nMelina and Bond share a romantic evening on board the Havelock yacht when a call arrives from MI6 on Bond's wristwatch. The British Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], wishes to speak to Bond personally. Bond gives the watch to Melina's parrot and the PM is tricked into thinking she's still speaking to Bond, who has joined Melina for a nude moonlight swim.",

    "Production": "''For Your Eyes Only'' was the first James Bond film whose original title was taken from an [[Ian Fleming]] short story rather than a novel. ''For Your Eyes Only'' was originally planned to be the next film after [[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|''The Spy Who Loved Me'']], and the end credits of the latter even advertised it as such. However, the producers switched plans and made [[Moonraker (film)|''Moonraker'']] instead after ''Star Wars'' became a massive success, prompting them to go for a more science-fiction-themed Bond film.\n\n===Writing===\n====Course correction by new creative====\nEven though the ''Moonraker'' movie was a big hit at the box office, the film got somewhat sour reception due to it's overblown spectacle. In response, ''For Your Eyes Only'' was to change the direction of the series' tone to be taken bit more seriously again.\n\n\n''For Your Eyes Only'' marked a creative change of direction for the Bond film series. [[Michael G. Wilson]], who had risen to executive producer on Moonraker and was now considered Broccoli's right-hand man, gained greater influence over the film series. He thought that James Bond should once again depend on his own abilities as a person and not just rely so much on high-tech tools anymore. \n\nThis sentiment was shared by [[John Glen]], who was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director, a position he would occupy throughout the 1980s. A result of this being a harder-edged directorial style, with less emphasis on gadgetry and large action sequences in huge arenas (as was favoured by [[Lewis Gilbert]]). More emphasis on tension, plot, and character was also added in addition to a return to Bond's more serious roots.\n\nAs the producers started to deem that [[Christopher Wood]]'s scripts didn't have enough excitement or internal logic, they brought back veteran Bond writer [[Richard Maibaum]] to create the screenplay along with Michael G. Wilson.\n\n====Elements====\n[[File:For Your Eyes Only - The Lotus explodes.png|thumb|300px|right|The destruction of the iconic Lotus Esprit from the 1970s was meant to symbolize a new, more grounded era for James Bond.]]\nThe title and some characters from Fleming's short story \"For Your Eyes Only\" were adopted, along with several other characters and plot elements from the short story \"[[Risico]].\" \n\nThe scene in which Bond and the Melina are pulled by a boat through a shark-infested coral reef is taken from the [[Live and Let Die (novel)|book ''Live and Let Die'']] and - although it was originally planned - it was not used in [[Live and Let Die (film)|the film of the same name]].\n\nThe introductory sequence was apparently written to introduce a potential new James Bond actor and connect him to earlier elements of the series. Bond visits the grave of his wife, who was murdered in [[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]], and eventually fights a character apparently meant to represent [[Blofeld]]. However, due to the unclear legal situation surrounding the character Blofeld, this name was not mentioned in the film or in the credits. At the time, the rights to [[Thunderball]], which presumably also included the rights to Blofeld and [[SPECTRE]], were owned by [[Kevin McClory]].\n\nTo symbolically underscore the new tonal direction for the series, director John Glen came up with the idea to have the [[Lotus Esprit]] (made famous in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'') to be destroyed and thus forcing Bond to use Melina's more humble [[Citroën 2CV]].\n\n===Casting===\nIt was originally planned to feature a new James Bond actor to succeed [[Roger Moore]]. During a July 1980 press conference for the movie ''[[Wikipedia:The Sea Wolves|The Sea Wolves]]'', Moore had announced that he is not going to play James Bond again. So, a search for new lead actor began, [[List of Actors Considered for James Bond|with potential successors considered]] being Michael Jayston, Nicholas Clay, Patrick Mower, David Warbeck, and [[Timothy Dalton]] (who would decline for the second time, ultimately to become Moore's successor in 1986). In September 1980, however, Roger Moore was persuaded to take on the lead role in ''For Your Eyes Only''.\n\n[[File:BondWiki Brosnan Harris 1981.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cassandra Harris (left) and Pierce Brosnan (right) attending a ''For Your Eyes Only'' promotional event circa May 1981. Pierce Brosnan would later become the 5th EON James Bond actor.]]\nCasting that would have ramifications for the future of the series was that of Australian actress [[Cassandra Harris]], who was cast in the supporting role of [[Lisl von Schlaf|Countess Lisl von Schlaf]]. At a dinner during filming, she introduced her fiancé, a then relatively unknown actor named [[Pierce Brosnan]], to producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]]. Although apparently having weak first impressions of Brosnan, Broccoli would grow like him, and even tried to have him as Moore's successor in 1986, being only derailed by contractual gaming regarding Brosnan's ''Remington Steele'' TV series and thus forcing Dalton to be asked again. Brosnan would eventually become Bond in 1994, with his first Bond movie being 1995's [[GoldenEye (film)|''GoldenEye'']], with Broccoli passing away shortly after its completion.\n\n[[Julian Glover]], who plays the villain [[Aris Kristatos]], was considered to play Bond in 1973's ''Live and Let Die'', but was deemed too young.\n\n===Shooting===\nProduction began on September 2, 1980, with three days of location shooting in the North Sea on the St. Georges ship. The interiors were then shot at Pinewood Studios, as was the ship's explosion, which was done in miniature on the 007 set.\n\nPrincipal photography began on September 15, 1980, on the island of Corfu, Greece. John Glen decided to use the local slopes and olive trees for the chase scene between Melina's Citroën 2CV and Gonzales' men's [[Peugeot 504]]. The scene was filmed over 12 days, with French stuntman Rémy Julienne (who worked on the saga up until ''GoldenEye'') driving the 2CV. Originally the villain cars were meant to be [[Mercedes-Benz]] models, but the stunt crew deemed that they were not agile enough to pull the necessary maneuvers during the chase, resulting in the production team securing some Peugeot 504 cars, which the team deemed satisfactory.\n\nIn October, the crew then traveled to the Achilleion Palace near the village of Gastouri and the Meteora Monasteries. The 30-meter fall from the rock of the monastery was performed by stuntman Rick Sylvester, who had already plunged into a ravine on skis in the opening sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me and then used a parachute to break his fall. Roger Moore, on the other hand, had an enormous fear of heights.\n\nIn November, filming moved to England, establishing itself at Pinewood Studios, with exterior pre-credits scenes at Stoke Poges Cemetery, Buckinghamshire, and above the Beckton Gasworks in East Ham, east London, while a second unit filmed underwater scenes in the Bahamas. \n\nOn January 1st 1981, filming continued in the Italian province of Belluno at Cortina d'Ampezzo in the northern Italian Dolomites, where trucks had to be used to bring in snow from the nearby mountains. The skiing and skating scenes used the ski jump, ice rink, and bobsleigh run from the 1956 Winter Olympics held in Cortina d'Ampezzo. However, there was a fatal accident during the shooting of the bobsleigh sequence, as on February 17, 1981, with stuntman Paolo Rigon was killed during the filming of the bobsled track portion of the ski chase. During the sequence, Rigon's sleigh overturned with Rigon trapped beneath. He later died due to the injuries he sustained.",

    "Comic book adaptation": "Prior to the film being released [[Marvel Comics]] was given permission to publish a comic book adaptation of the movie, ''For Your Eyes Only''. It was first released as issue 11 in the graphic novel sized 'Marvel Comics Super Special' series in July 1981, and then in regular comic book size as a two-issue limited series published in July (cover dated October/November 1981). It was also reprinted the same year in paperback book form.\n\nAlthough a British comic strip had been published almost without interruption since the 1950s, this was only the second American-published comic version of a Bond story, after DC Comic's publication of ''[[Dr. No (comic)|Dr. No]]'' 18 years earlier. Marvel Comics would go on to produce a comic book version of ''Octopussy'' in the same 'Marvel Comics Super Special' series.\n\nTwo major differences in the comic book include the addition of M, who was technically in the initial drafts of the screenplay until Bernard Lee's death in early 1981, and the villain's given name, which for unknown reasons was \"Ari Kristatos\" instead of the film version's \"Aris Kristatos.\" The comic also includes additional suggestive dialogue by Bibi Dahl (aimed at Bond) that was never used (or was perhaps was edited from) the film.\n\nCredits for both issues of the comic book adaptation include:\n*Written by Larry Hama\n*Penciller: Howard Chaykin\n*Inker: Vince Colletta\n*Letterer: Jean Simek\n*Colorist: Christie Scheele\n*Editor: Dennis O'Neil",

    "Legacy": "Today ''For Your Eyes Only'' is often considered a contender alongside ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' as Moore's best Bond film. Overall, ''For Your Eyes Only'' accumulated a box office gross of $195,300,000, which at the time was the second highest grossing Bond film after its previous entry ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''.\n\n===Controversial aspects===\n====Blofeld or not?====\n''For Your Eyes Only'' is perhaps most notable for its pre-title sequence which shows the final comeuppance of the supervillain [[Blofeld (Hollis/Rietty)|Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], Bond's enemy in five previous films (although the character here is unnamed due to legal issues). \n\nThe reason the appearance of the Blofeld character remains somewhat ambiguous here (he is not explicitly named, despite his demise clearly being of huge importance to the series) relate to a legal battle dating back to the publication of the James Bond novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'' in 1961. At that time, [[Kevin McClory]] claimed that [[Ian Fleming]] had adapted the novel from a screenplay for a proposed film adaptation of the Bond character that the two had worked on together, and that ''he'', not Fleming, had come up with the S.P.E.C.T.R.E. organisation and the character of Ernst Stavro Blofeld. \n\nAs the legal dispute had left McClory with the rights to the Blofeld character, the studio was forced to leave Blofeld's appearance in ''For Your Eyes Only'' ambiguous (while at the same time using many of the character's well-known traits from earlier movies - bald head, [[Blofeld's cat|white cat]] - to convey the message of who he really was<ref>This despite the fact that EON had been able to use Blofeld and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. unambiguously in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', ''[[One Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' and ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'', despite Blofeld not appearing in the original ''Diamonds'' novel.</ref>). \n\nThe demise of Blofeld finally tied up the plot hole of his disappearance in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'', and was added by the production staff to show that the James Bond series did not need Blofeld and was content to move on after a number of attempts by Kevin McClory to produce a rival Bond film based on his ownership of the character. This includes a failed attempt in the late 1970s of an original Bond film that resulted in a lawsuit brought about by [[EON Productions|EON]] and [[United Artists]]. Nevertheless McClory was able to film a remake of ''Thunderball'' entitled ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' which was released opposite ''[[Octopussy]]'' in 1983 (and the character of Blofeld returned to the EON series in the mid-2010s).\n\n====Poster====\nTwo other controversial incidents also occurred with the release of ''For Your Eyes Only''. The first involving the film's teaser poster artwork, which showcased a model in thong-like shorts holding a crossbow with Bond framed between her long legs. This was deemed in some U.S. states as indecent exposure. A later version of the teaser was released with a superimposed pair of shorts painted over the original artwork. \n\n====Tula====\nThe other controversial incident wasn't revealed until some time after the release, in which it was discovered that one of the \"Bond girls\" in the film, Caroline Cossey (aka [[Tula]]) was transgender. Although this fact was made known concurrently with the film's release - with Cossey even posing nude for ''Playboy'' - gained attention years later when Tula was a guest on the Howard Stern show, in which Stern expressed admiration that even the Bond producers were fooled. Due to both controversies, it was incorrectly assumed by some to be one and the same, i.e. Tula was the girl on the poster. However, this is untrue; an unnamed model served as the \"crossbow girl\", whereas Tula was briefly seen at Hector Gonzalez's pool party.\n\n====Absence of M====\nThroughout the entire James Bond series of films, this is the only movie where [[M]] is absent. [[Bernard Lee]] had died while preparing for the film, and instead of recasting, the role was left vacant out of respect. Miss Moneypenny, M's personal secretary claims that he is on leave, and his chair is filled by his 'Chief of Staff', [[Bill Tanner]], with M's lines being shared between Tanner and the Minister of Defence. The role was [[Robert Brown|recast]] for ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]''.\n\n====Locque's death====\nThe change in the film's tone from the previous entry is maybe at its clearest in the scene in which Bond kicks a car with a villain Locque inside over a cliff, essentially murdering him in cold blood. This was, and still is to this day controversial amongst fans to whether [[Ian Fleming]]'s James Bond would commit such an act. Roger Moore was also strongly opposed to the aforementioned scene in which Bond kills the villain Locque, claiming his Bond wouldn't do such a thing. \n\nThis, however, contradicts the fact that his Bond kills at least two, possibly three people in cold blood in the earlier film, ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (namely, a thug Bond lets fall off a roof, the villain [[Karl Stromberg]] who Bond executes after he's been disarmed, and possibly [[Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi)|Fiona Volpe]] who Bond intentionally use as a human shield) in [[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]. Nonetheless, this scene was the strongest display of Bond exercising his license to kill since the killing of Professor Dent by [[Sean Connery]]'s Bond in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.\n\n===Action sequences===\nAs mentioned earlier, this movie turned from deux ex machina gadgets and wide-open action sequences to smaller and more \"personal\" scenes. The resulting sequences are arguably some of the best of the series, and are generally extremely well filmed.\n\nOne example of the change in thinking is the simple scene in which Bond confronts the killer Locque. Locque is attempting to escape in a car, but is forced to drive up a steep hill along a road containing a number of sharp switchback curves. Bond follows on foot, running up a set of stairways bisecting the road. When the race first starts, Locque is far ahead of Bond, but as Bond reaches the next section of the road after climbing one section it is clear he is gaining on him. The scene ends with Bond climbing the last remaining flight, quite out of breath, with the camera positioned to show him reaching the road slightly ''ahead'' of Locque. The entire scene is perhaps 30 seconds, and is extremely suspenseful.\n\nA more famous scene occurs late in the movie when Bond's team attempts to break into a mountaintop monastery being used by Kristatos to meet Gogol and turn over the ATAC. In order to gain access to the mountaintop one would normally use a cablecar, but this is being guarded. Instead Bond climbs up the sheer face of the mountain, out of sight of the guards. As he climbs he has to knock pitons into the rock face, and eventually one of the guards hears him and investigates. He sees Bond, who hides, and instead climbs down a rope of his own to start knocking out the pitons. The scene continues with Bond attempting to climb back onto the rock face, but falling further as each piton is knocked out. He eventually reaches a safe position just as the guard is in the process of knocking out the last piton, potentially sending Bond falling to the rock far below. Bond then whistles to attract the guard's attention, and uses a piton as a throwing knife to kill him, using the guard's rope to climb the rest of the way.",

    "Trivia": "[[File:Sheena Easton.png|right|250px|thumb|[[Sheena Easton]] is to date the only performer of a Bond song to appear in a titles sequence.]]\n*The \"Burglar Protected\" stickers on Bond's Lotus came from a car alarm company called Autosafe.\n*In the end credits of [[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|''The Spy Who Loved Me'']] it says \"James Bond will return in For Your Eyes Only,\" however after the tremendous box office success of ''[[w:c:starwars:Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|Star Wars: Episode IV&nbsp;A New Hope]]'' in 1977 the producers decided they wanted to cash in on the subsequent science fiction craze and make [[Moonraker (film)|''Moonraker'']] instead, thus For Your Eyes Only was held back to become the next Bond film after Moonraker. Ironically, For Your Eyes Only was produced as a conscious attempt to pull back from the sci-fi trappings of the previous two Bond films.\n*Cassandra Harris was married to future Bond actor [[Pierce Brosnan]].\n*In the film, Bibi is infatuated with Bond (played by 54 year old Roger Moore). Later in the movie she believes that Kristatos (played by 46 year old Julian Glover) is attempting to move her to Cuba with hopes of seducing her and claims he's too old for her. In real life Moore is eight years older than Glover. But it is made clear that Bond is still meant to be in his 40s while Kristatos is much older than the actor portraying him.\n* This is the first of only two Bond films in which General Gogol is depicted as an actual adversary, though he departs on good terms with Bond here, possibly because of their interaction in ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.\n* First James Bond film to feature a real-life politician or public figure, although being portrayed by someone else, in this case the then-incumbent British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] who was played in the film by Janet Brown.\n*[[Bernard Lee]], who portrayed M in the first eleven Bond films, died in January 1981 before his scenes as M were filmed. Out of respect, a new M is not featured in this film as Broccoli refused to have the character recast, with Moneypenny saying (in a somber tone) that M is \"on leave.\" Lee's dialogue is distributed among [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]], [[Bill Tanner (James Villiers)|Bill Tanner]] and [[Fredrick Gray|Frederick Gray]]. To date this is the only Bond film in which an individual identified as M does not appear. There wouldn't be a new M until the next film, ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'' with [[Robert Brown]] in the role.\n*[[Julian Glover]], who plays Aristotle Kristatos, previously tried out for the role of Bond.\n*In 1980-early 1981 some news media, including the noted SF magazine ''Starlog'' erroneously identified this movie by the title ''Sea Wolves'', confusing it with the Second World War thriller of that title in which Moore played a 007-like character, despite that film being released in the spring of 1980. ''Sea Wolves'' also co-starred [[David Niven]] and [[Patrick Macnee]].\n*A few days before the film's release, Moore appeared in the comedy film ''The Cannonball Run'' playing a man named Sydney Goldfarb who believed he was Roger Moore playing James Bond; he spends the film in a Bond-like tuxedo, spoofing the 007 character, and his character drives an [[Aston Martin DB5]] in the movie. At the time he filmed the spoof, Moore was expecting ''For Your Eyes Only'' to be his final Bond film.\n*This was the first Bond film to be released in the 1980's and the first to be released in the two-year chronological odd-number gap.\n*John Glen's first Bond film as the Director.\n*This is the last Bond film to be distributed by United Artist before it absorbed by Metro-Golden-Mayers films.\n*This is also the only 1980's Bond film not to feature [[Robert Brown]] as M.",
