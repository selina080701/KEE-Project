It was released in 1999, and produced by [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]]. The film's story and screenplay was written by [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis]] and [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Robert Wade]] who later teamed again for 2002's ''[[Die Another Day]]'', 2006's ''[[Casino Royale]]'', and 2008's ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''. It is the final film to have to [[Desmond Llewelyn]] as [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]] released one month before his death on December 19, 1999.\n\nThe title comes from the English translation of the Bond family motto, the Latin ''Orbis non sufficit'', which was established and adopted by James Bond in Fleming's novel, ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.",
    "Synopsis": "[[MI6]] is humiliated when [[James Bond (Pierce Brosnan)|James Bond]] gets tricked into delivering a bomb that kills British oil tycoon [[Sir Robert King]] - a personal friend of [[M (Judi Dench) (classic film continuity)|M]] - and damages the [[SIS Building]]. With King's daughter [[Elektra]] inhering the family oil business, it appears that [[Renard]] - the terrorist who had kidnapped her prior - is targeting her again. Feeling guilt over failure to save Sir King and being moved by Elektra's vulnerability, Bond convinces M to assign him to protect Elektra from harm. While on duty, Bond also teams up with nuclear physicist [[Christmas Jones]], as Renard has stolen a nuclear bomb for unknown end game, and the more he learns, the less innocent Elektra starts to look.",
    "Plot summary": "===Bilbao===\n[[File:Giulietta offering cigars to Bond.png|thumb|right|300px|James Bond at the Swiss bank in Bilbao.]]\nIn [[Bilbao]], the capital of the Basque Country in [[Spain]], [[James Bond (Pierce Brosnan)|James Bond]] goes to the regional office of [[La Banque Suisse de L'Industrie]] to meet with a Swiss banker known as [[Lachaise]]. The meeting begins, with Lachaise under the impression that Bond is to recover a large sum of ransom money intended for a British oil tycoon [[Sir Robert King]]. However, Bond brings up that the money was used to buy reports that were stolen from an [[0012 (The World Is Not Enough)|fellow MI6 agent]], who was murdered over them. Bond inquires the murderer's identity and Lachaise implores Bond to take the money and ask no further questions at risk of death.\n\nAs Lachaise's guards begin to draw their guns, Bond uses a flash bang grenade disguised as his handgun (triggered with the [[Detonator Spectacles]]) to surprise the men and swiftly takes them out. Bond holds Lachaise at gunpoint with [[M1911 Pistol|a pistol]] from one of the guards, again demanding the identity of the MI6 agent's killer. As Lachaise is about to relent, he is then killed by a knife thrown by [[Giulietta da Vinci|his female secretary]].\n\nThe woman escapes with police arriving to the scene. Bond locks the office door and as he attempts to flee through the window, one of the guards had gotten up and almost shoots Bond, before the guard is shot by [[Renard|an unseen sniper]]. The police arrive banging the door, with Bond tying a widow cord onto a another barely conscious and escapes the office with suitcase containing King's money.\n\n===London===\nAt [[MI6]] headquarters in [[London]], Bond returns the [[Money Bomb|money]] to a wealthy businessman named [[Sir Robert King]]. King  is and old friend of [[M (Judi Dench) (classic film continuity)|M]]. Bond learns that King is building an oil pipeline through the Caucasus region and that the project has been threatened with destruction from several competing factions. The money was ransom payment for King's kidnapped daughter. M hands Bond a glass of bourbon with ice and when the ice begins to foam up on his fingers, Bond deduces that the money may itself be an explosive. In a nearby lab, the metallic security strip in one of the bills explodes that Elektra used her father’s pin as a detonator, killing King and blowing a large hole in the outer wall of MI6 HQ. Bond spots a woman on a boat who tries to shoot him with a rifle\n\nBond snatches the [[Q-Boat|small, experimental, jet-powered boat]] belonging to [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]] and races after the woman, chasing her down the Thames and London streets. She tries several times to evade him however Bond catches up with her, finally destroying her boat near the Millennium Dome with a torpedo. The woman commandeers a hot-air balloon, with Bond hanging on to one of the anchor ropes. The woman, the Cigar Smoking Woman, points her handgun at the gas tanks on the balloon. Bond pleads with her not to fire, claiming MI6 will protect her. She says no one can protect her from \"him\". She then shoots the tanks and the balloon explodes, killing her and dropping Bond onto the Dome. The rolling and falling fractures his collarbone, but he's still able to arrest his slide down the side of the Dome by grabbing onto the support cables.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[File:TWiNE - Scottish Meeting Room.png|thumb|right|300px|M holding an emergency meeting with the 00 agents.]]\nSir King's funeral is held at his family home in [[Glen Darrock Estate]], with Bond, Moneypenny and M attending it. While there, Bond notices King's daughter, [[Elektra King|Elektra]], for the first time. \n\nAt [[Castle Thane|an MI6 retreat]] in [[Scotland]], M assembles the [[00 agents]] to investigate the attack on the MI6 headquarters. Despite being present however, Bond is excluded from the investigation.\n\nWhile working on his own, Bond discovers that Elektra was kidnapped sometime prior and held ransom. He notices that the money he recovered for King is equal to the ransom and concludes that King's death was a message. \n\nHe heads to a briefing chaired by M who states that the suspect behind the bombing is a man named Victor Zokas, aka \"[[Renard]]\", an international terrorist. Renard had had been the mastermind behind Elektra's kidnapping but Elektra managed to escape by seducing her guards and killing them. Renard was subsequently hunted down by [[009 (The World Is Not Enough)|009]], who managed to shoot him in the head but the terrorist miraculously managed to survive. The bullet, still lodged in Renard's head, has slowly been travelling through and destroying the area of his brain that controls his senses. As a result, Renard no longer feels pain and is now able to push himself to the limits of human endurance until the bullet eventually kills him. \n\nM initially refuses Bond to take the assignment. However, 007 has seduced the MI6 Chief Medical Officer, [[Molly Warmflash]], who has declared him healthy. M thus orders Bond to protect King's daughter.\n\n===Azerbaijan===\nBond travels to Elektra's location near Baku, [[Azerbaijan]], where she is overseeing the construction of her father's pipeline. He first comes in contact with [[Sasha Davidov]], head of King Industries's security, where they see many Azeri protestors. Apparently this place is of religious significance. Elektra arrives and announces the pipeline is to be diverted away from this area, causing the protestors to cheer that their demands have been met, in spite of Davidov's protest that changing her father's plans will add to the cost. Bond meets Elektra in private, where he learns about King's company being competing with three Russian oil companies. Bond tries to convince her to allow him to guard her, but she is reluctant, as in her eyes, MI6 has failed one too many times. Bond persists, with Elektra allow Bond to accompany her to ski trip near one of the pipelines.\n\nAt the [[Caucasus Mountains]], Elektra demonstrates the pipeline to Bond and tells a bit about her family politics. They are then attacked by a small group of armed assassins piloting \"[[Parahawk]]\" vehicles. Bond is able to stop them, causing a few of them to collide with the landscape or each other and explode. The last explosion causes an avalanche, burying Bond and Elektra. Bond deploys a rapid-inflating sphere to protect them, but Elektra panics from claustrophobia.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki TWINE Elektra Zukovsky1.png|thumb|left|300px|Zukovsky claiming Elektra's bet.]]\nSeeking further information about Elektra's attackers, Bond goes to [[Le Casino L'Or Noir|a casino]] owned by his old rival, [[Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane)|Valentin Zukovsky]], to find out more about Renard and the men who attacked him earlier. Zukovsky tells Bond that Renard was a former [[KGB]] agent and may be working for Russian oil barons in the region who want the King pipeline destroyed. They are summoned back to the main floor where Elektra has come to the casino to show she isn't afraid of her enemies . She loses on a high-low card draw.\n\nIn [[The Devil's Breath|a Hindu pilgrim site]], Renard meets with Elektra's security chief [[Sasha Davidov|Davidov]] and nuclear weapons scientist [[Dr. Mikhail Arkov|Arkov]], who also secretly works for Renard. Renard kills Arkov for failing to kill Elektra earlier and orders Davidov to take Arkov's place on a secret mission the next day. Bond slips out of Elektra's [[Elektra's Estate|mansion]] after making love to her and goes to Davidov's office, looking for more leads. When Davidov returns, Bond kills him and manages to take his place on a plane.\n\n===Kazakhstan===\n[[File:TWiNE - Pomotional photograph of 007 and Renard (1).jpg|thumb|334x334px]]\nBond secretly accompanies Renard's men to Kazakhstan, to a [[Kazakhstan Nuclear Test Facility|decrepit Soviet underground nuclear weapons facility]] where warheads are distmantled. He meets the head scientist, [[Christmas Jones|Dr. Christmas Jones]] and goes down into one of the silos and finds Renard and his men stealing an active warhead. He briefly captures Renard and tries to force the criminal to reveal his plan. Renard resists, feeling no pain from Bond's blows. During the improvised interrogation, Renard uses a phrase Bond had previously heard from Elektra, \"There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.\" and reveals that he was the sniper during the encounter on Bilbao. Bond also notices that one of Renard's men has removed an electronic card from the bomb.\n\nAt that moment, Dr. Jones and other guards enter and she accuses Bond of being an impostor. Bond is forced to his knees by Renard, who presses on Bond's injured collarbone. Bond, Renard and his henchmen are about to be arrested when Renard's crew opens fire and cause an intensive firefight. He escapes with the scientist, though Renard has stolen the nuclear warhead, and the card was a tracking device.\n\n===Baku===\nBond returns to Baku and harshly confronts Elektra, suspecting that Elektra and Renard are in collusion. Elektra has convinced M to meet her and wen M arrives, Bond gives her a card and tells her his theory. M disbelieves him when suddenly, an alarm sounds. Renard has planted the warhead he stole on an inspection car that's travelling down the pipeline. Bond and Jones use another of the vehicles so that the scientist can defuse the warhead. While Jones dismantles the device, she finds that only half of the plutonium is there. Bond tells her to let the explosive charge detonate to create an illusion that they have killed.\n\n[[File:IMG0053 Gallery-320x221.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Elektra reveals her true colors to M.]]\nBack at Elektra's command center, she gives the visibly upset M a gift: her father's lapel pin and her men kill M's guards. Elektra tells M that she killed her father out of revenge for using her to bait Renard. Bond and Jones are puzzled as to why Renard only used half of the plutonium.\n\nBond once again visits Zukovsky, this time at his caviar factory. While trying to gather further information from Zukovsky, they are attacked by Elektra's helicopters, which are armed with hanging circular saw blades. Bond is able to destroy one of the helicopters with missiles fired from his BMW, but the other chopper saws his car in half. Bond uses a [[Flare Gun]] to ignite leaking gas from a nearby pipe, destroying the second helicopter. In the confusion, Zukovsky falls into a pit of his own caviar. While he struggles to free himself, Bond asks him what his connection to Elektra is. The former KGB agent tells him that he'd arranged for his nephew, a Russian [[Victor-III class submarine]] captain, to smuggle one submarine out of Russia and the Casino card payment was her payment to Zukovsky.\n\n===Istanbul===\nIn [[Istanbul]], Bond and Zukovsky work to discern Renard's plan. They figure out that a nuclear explosion in Istanbul would contaminate the Bosphorus, preventing all shipping out of the Black Sea, and rendering the Russian oil pipelines useless. That would leave only one viable method of extracting petroleum from the Caspian region: the pipeline owned by King Industries. The submarine will be made to explode, using the stolen plutonium, and will look like an accident. When Bond and Zukovsky determine where the sub is docked, near the [[Maiden's Tower]], Zukovsky's assistant, [[Mister Bullion]], rushes out of the room, having planted an IED hidden in his briefcase. Bond and Jones manage to escape; however, Zukovsky is knocked unconscious. Outside the command center, Bond and Jones are captured by Renard's men. Renard kills the entire submarine crew by poisoning them, then leaves Elektra, so he can face his death knowing it will be the ultimate act of terrorism.\n\nBond is taken to the Maiden's Tower and delivered to Elektra while Renard hold Jones captive on the stolen submarine. Elektra has Bond shackled to an antique chair, turning a screw to cut off his breathing. Suddenly, Zukovsky and his men appear, killing Renard's and Elektra's men. When Zukovsky reaches the room where Elektra has Bond, he sees his nephew's captain's hat on a nearby table and he demands Elektra to return it to him. She, however, shoots Zukovsky. She turns her attention back to Bond, but the dying Zukovsky fires a bullet from his cane gun, freeing one of Bond's shackles. 007 escapes and chases after Elektra freeing M along the way. \n\n[[File:The World is Not Enough - Bond vs Elektra.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bond confronting Elektra.]]\nBond corners Elektra at the top of the tower. Bond orders her to radio the submarine and call off the destruction of Istanbul. However, Elektra claims Bond cannot kill her because he loves her too much. When Renard responds over radio, she orders him to dive -- which prompts Bond to callously shoot her dead. M arrives and finds dead Elektra and Bond dismayed at the outcome. James Bond dives into the water and barely gets inside the submarine before it dives.\n\n===Submarine===\nInside the submarine Bond first frees Christmas, then tries to bring the submarine to the surface to get authorities involved. The plan does not quite go right, but the submarine capsizes and hits the bottom, causing a breach in the hull.\n\nWith Renard is trapped in the reactor room and the compartments starting to fill with water, Bond, with Dr. Jones's help, goes through an exit outside the submarine to the reactor room. There, Bond finds Renard starting to insert the [[Plutonium Rod|plutonium rod]] into the reactor to complete the initial plan. Bond attacks Renard to halt the insertion, with the plutonium rod dropping below. Fight ensues, with Bond having to rescue Jones from drowning inside a compartment.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki TWINE BondVsRenard1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bond and Renard's climactic fight.]]\nJones begins explaining the reactor, but Renard gets back up and strikes Bond, attempting to continue the insertion. Bond and Renard fight, as they struggle for the control of the plutonium rod. During struggle, Bond tells Renard that Elektra is dead, which enrages the terrorist. In a fit of rage, he overpowers Bond and traps him behind bars. Renard continues the insertion and comes very close to succeeding before a hose blows out of the pressurization system, which gives Bond the means of defeating Renard.\n\nWith Bond reattaching the hose, he activates the emergency ejection and causes the plutonium rod to propel out of the reactor, which lunges right at Renard - perforating his heart and killing him instantly. The submarine is at risk of exploding due to too high a concentration of explosive gas, and James and Christmas escape through a torpedo tube before the submarine explodes.\n\n===Epilogue===\n[[File:TWiNE - Bond and Christmas celebrate the New Year.png|thumb|right|300px|James Bond and Christmas Jones celebrating the turn of the millennium together.]]\nWith the mission complete, 007 can enjoy New Year's Eve 2000 in Istanbul with Dr. Jones. Back at MI6, the staff searches for Bond and Jones. Using the new body sensor gadget, they find them in Istanbul. They locate them just as they are making love, with their body temperatures escalating quickly. Realizing what's happening, R quickly disables the device and lies to M by saying it is a glitch likely caused by a premature form of the \"Millennium Bug\".",

Renard continues the insertion and comes very close to succeeding before a hose blows out of the pressurization system, which gives Bond the means of defeating Renard.\n\nWith Bond reattaching the hose, he activates the emergency ejection and causes the plutonium rod to propel out of the reactor, which lunges right at Renard - perforating his heart and killing him instantly. The submarine is at risk of exploding due to too high a concentration of explosive gas, and James and Christmas escape through a torpedo tube before the submarine explodes.",

They were hired by [[Barbara Broccoli]] and [[Michael G. Wilson]] thanks to the screenwriter duo's work on Plunkett & Macleane. Besides them, [[Dana Stevens]] and [[Bruce Feirstein]] provided additional script doctoring.\n\nThe plot involving an oil company at Caspian sea was apparently an idea of Barbara Broccoli got from a November 1997 newsreport on Nightline, in which it was detailed how world's largest oil companies were vying for control of the untapped oil reserves in the Caspian Sea, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Wade and Purvis are credited with the idea of making the main villain a woman, which, while already explored in the [[James Bond Comic Strip]]s and the continuation novels by [[John Gardner]] and [[Raymond Benson]], marked the first time in the EON-produced Bond movie where that was the case. It said that the concept was that \"with Elektra, Bond thinks he has found [[Tracy Bond (Diana Rigg)|Tracy]], but he's really found [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld (classic film continuity)|Blofeld]]\".\n\n===Staff===\nThe film was originally offered to Joe Dante and Peter Jackson to direct.

    "Marketing & Merchandise": "[[File:Twine_concept.jpg|thumb|250px|Concept teaser poster.]]\nThe World is Not Enough was initially known popularly as \"Bond 2000\", based on the supposed planned release date in the year 2000. Other rumored guesses for the title were ''Death Waits for No Man'', ''Fire and Ice'', ''Pressure Point'' and ''Dangerously Yours.'' \n\nAt the time of the film's release, MGM signed a marketing partnership with MTV, primarily for American youths who were assumed to have considered Bond to be \"an old-fashioned secret service agent\". As a result MTV broadcast more than 100 hours of Bond-related programs immediately after the film was released, most being presented by Denise Richards.\nThe BMW Z8 driven by Bond in the film was the final part of a three-movie product placement deal with BMW (which began with the Z3 in GoldenEye and continued with the 750iL in Tomorrow Never Dies). Other promotional and product placement partners included Omega SA, Heineken, Smirnoff, evian, and Wilkinson Sword.\n\nThe film was released on DVD and VHS on 16 May 2000, and sold over 5 million copies. The initial release of the DVD includes the featurette \"Secrets of 007\", which cuts into \"making of\" material during the movie; the documentary \"The Making of The World Is Not Enough\"; two commentary tracks—one by director Michael Apted, and the other by production designer Peter Lamont, second unit director Vic Armstrong, and composer David Arnold; a trailer for the video game, the Garbage music video, and a \"making of\" booklet which featured trivia on the film's production and stills from the film. The Ultimate Edition boxed set release from 2006 had, as additional extras a 2000 documentary named \"Bond Cocktail\", a featurette on shooting the Q Boat scenes, Pierce Brosnan in a press conference in Hong Kong, deleted scenes, and a tribute to Desmond Llewelyn. The Ultimate edition was re-released individually in 2008 on DVD and Blu-ray; most recently it has been released as part of The James Bond 50th anniversary Blu-ray set and in bare-bones dvd form.\n\n===[[The World Is Not Enough (soundtrack)|Soundtrack]]===\n\nFeaturing \"The World Is Not Enough\" performed by Garbage, the main soundtrack was composed by [[David Arnold]].

    "Trivia": "===Gardner connection?===\nAlthough the producers have not acknowledged it, the film appears to have borrowed many elements from [[James Bond Books|James Bond continuation novels]]. In particular, many elements first seen in [[John Gardner]]'s [[SeaFire]] and [[COLD]] appear here:\n* M's kidnapping occurs in [[COLD]], which has also occurred previously in [[Kingsley Amis]]'s James Bond novel ''[[Colonel Sun]]''.\n* [[COLD]] features a Bond Girl - [[Sukie Tempesta]] (who was first introduced in [[Nobody Lives for Ever]]) - first appearing as a love interest before revealing herself a villain. Also both in COLD and the movie, the female main villain dies before Bond goes to deal with the male main villain. Such similiar misdirection regarding the female villain also occured in Gardner's [[For Special Services]], in which the audience is mislead into believing that [[Markus Bismaquer]] is the main villain (like with [[Renard]]), with it later revealed that [[Nena Bismaquer]] is the real mastermind.\n* The main villain of [[COLD]] - General Brutus \"Brute\" Clay - is a terrorist, like Renard is. Whereas Brutus Clay is a [[Wikipedia:American militia movement|American militia movement]]-style terrorist and Renard is a anarchist, these two ideologies have a fair bit of overlap.\n*[[SeaFire]] features a submarine as a major location in later part of the story, which is a integral part of the villain's scheme. In both instances, Bond has to destroy it and then escape out of underwater (with Bond using a Steinke hood in the novel).\n* Also in SeaFire, oil place a large part in the story, as well as plot development involving a Bond Girl getting killed/mortally harmed late in the story.\n* SeaFire also features a vehicle called Powerchute, which is quite similar to the [[Parahawk]]s featured in the film.\n* One of the film's settings, Baku in [[Azerbaijan]], is also one of the settings of Gardner's 1991 Bond novel, ''[[The Man from Barbarossa]]''.\n* The King family's home - [[Glen Darrock Estate]] - is in Scotland.

He was replaced by [[John Cleese]] as [[Q (John Cleese)|Q]] in the next film, who already appeared in this film as R, his intended successor.\n* During filming of the opening boat chase, web cams were set up overlooking the Thames River and Internet users could watch the filming from around the world.\n* This was the first official James Bond film not to have the [[United Artists]] logo at the start or at the end. All James Bond films starting with this film have the standard [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] logo.\n* This film is notable as being one of the few Bond movies in which James himself kills a leading female character. In the scene, Bond points a gun at Elektra and threatens to shoot her if she contacts the enemy on her two-way radio. She replies that he can't kill her, because \"You would miss me,\" possibly referring to their romantic involvement. He says nothing, and in the crucial moment, she defies him, alerting the enemy, and he promptly shoots her. Standing over her body, he says, tersely: \"I never miss.\" An early version of the script has Bond shoot her in cold blood before she actually attempts to contact Renard. A longstanding stereotype regarding James Bond is that 007 routinely kills women he beds; in truth, the death of Elektra is the only occasion in the EON Bond film series in which this undeniably occurs (It is debatable whether Bond actually kills [[Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi)|Fiona Volpe]] in ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' or if she is a victim of her men's poor shooting skills; he does, however, directly kill the [[Fatima Blush|version of the character]] that appears in the non-EON film, ''[[Never Say Never Again (film)|Never Say Never Again]]'').\n* First James Bond film to show [[SIS Building|MI6 Headquarters]] being attacked, although not completely destroyed.\n*The fictional news report which Bond views from the MI6 Archive was provided by BBC News. This was out of date by the time the film was released (November 1999) as the BBC relaunched their news output in May and [[Martyn Lewis]] (the newsreader) left the corporation at the same time.\n*The pipeline featured in the film is a thinly disguised fictional version of the real Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which runs from the Caspian to the Mediterranean via the Caucasus. Unlike the film's \"King pipeline\", however, the BTC pipeline is almost entirely underground. As in the film, it is the only land route by which oil can be transported from the Caucasus to the Mediterranean.\n*Elektra's father is named Robert King. This is also the name of the co-writer of ''Your Deal, Mr. Bond'', a collection of bridge-related short stories that included an unauthorised James Bond story.\n*The film ends with a joking reference to the Millennium Bug. More commonly referred to as Y2K, this was based on a well-publicised prediction that the rollover from 1999 to 2000 might cause widespread computer failures. This is one of the few moments in the Bond film series that directly ties it to a specific point in time.\n*When [[Sean Connery]] received the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, Pierce Brosnan, in his tribute, revealed that Connery visited the set and watched Brosnan film one of the movie's action sequences. Afterwards, Brosnan joked, Connery asked Brosnan if they were paying him enough money.\n*This is the first James Bond film to have a pivotal chasing scene filmed on the Thames River, which would occur again 16 years later during the climax of ''[[Spectre (film)|Spectre]]''.\n*This was the last ''Bond'' movie to be released in the 20th century and before the September the Eleventh attacks in New York.\n*This is the first James Bond film with the gunbarrel sequence's white dot expands to clearly reveal Bond himself, at closeup shoot. (In ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', the dots expanding to the first shot of scenes shows Bond at an extreme distance, who could also be presumed as somebody else entering the graveyard instead of Bond)\n*The last James Bond film to be released in the 1990's and the last to be released in the chronological two year odd-numbered gap.",
    "Gardner connection?": "Although the producers have not acknowledged it, the film appears to have borrowed many elements from [[James Bond Books|James Bond continuation novels]]. In particular, many elements first seen in [[John Gardner]]'s [[SeaFire]] and [[COLD]] appear here:\n* M's kidnapping occurs in [[COLD]], which has also occurred previously in [[Kingsley Amis]]'s James Bond novel ''[[Colonel Sun]]''.\n* [[COLD]] features a Bond Girl - [[Sukie Tempesta]] (who was first introduced in [[Nobody Lives for Ever]]) - first appearing as a love interest before revealing herself a villain. Also both in COLD and the movie, the female main villain dies before Bond goes to deal with the male main villain.
