The main cast was rounded out by [[Gert Fröbe]] and [[Honor Blackman]]. The film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and was the first of four Bond films directed by [[Guy Hamilton]].\n\nThe film is generally regarded as the first official Bond blockbuster as well as being the template for all future Bond films; it is usually credited with triggering what is known as the \"James Bond craze\". The film made cinematic history when it recaptured its production costs in record-setting time, despite a budget equal to that of the two preceding films combined. ''Goldfinger'' was also the second Bond film to use a pop star to sing the theme song during the titles, the first being \"From Russia With Love, sung by British pop star Matt Monro. Every other Bond film would include a pop star song, except ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''. This is also the last Bond film to use the original [[Bob Simmons]] Gunbarrel sequence, which was first used in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.",
    "Synopsis": "After foiling a heroin operation in [[Mexico]], James Bond travels to [[United States|Miami]] to relax. While there, he is approached by [[Felix Leiter (Cec Linder)|Felix Leiter]], who makes Bond aware of the presence of wealthy metallurgy entrepreneur [[Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe)|Auric Goldfinger]]. After Bond spoils Goldfinger's gambling fraud with help of latter's female aide-de-camp, Goldfinger retaliates by having the woman killed. Upon return to England, [[M (Bernard Lee)|M]] assigns Bond investigate Goldfinger, who is suspected of gold smuggling. Shadowing Goldfinger, Bond comes to learn of former's scheme targeting [[United States]]' gold reserve in [[Fort Knox]] in Kentucky.",
    "Plot summary": "===Mexico===\n[[File:Bondwiki GoFi64 BondRevealTux1.png|thumb|right|250px|James Bond taking off his sneaking suit to reveal a white tuxedo.]]\nThe movie starts in Mexico, where [[James Bond (Sean Connery)|James Bond]] stealthily swims to a pier of a Mexican port. Bond gets out of the water and - by using a [[Grappling Pistol|grappling gun]] - gets over a wall into the drug manufacturing complex. After taking out a guard, Bond finds a entrance to one of the drug labs and sets [[plastic explosives]] with a timer and leaves.\n\nHaving gotten out, he removes his black diving suit to reveal a white tuxedo and heads to the El Scorpio nightclub. There, belly dancer [[Bonita]] is performing while Bond blends with the crowd. As he lights his cigar, the bombs at the drug complex go off, destroying it. Customers at the nightclub panic due to the explosion and leave, with Bond's contact congratulating him for destruction of [[Mr. Ramirez]]'s operation to use drugs to fund revolutionary action. The contact recommends leaving to Miami immediately, but Bond wants to check on Bonita.\n\nAt her dressing room, Bond finds Bonita bathing. He starts to romance Bonita, only for her to be bothered by Bond's gun holster. Bond removes his holster and continues where he left off. While making love, Bond sees [[Capungo|an assassin]] from the reflection of Bonita's eye. Bond avoids injury and fights the thug, eventually throwing him to the bathtub. The assailant tries to reach for the [[Walther PPK]] in Bond's holster, with quick acting Bond throwing an nearby electric-powered table fan into the bathtub, killing the assailant. Bond gets his holster and leaves Bonita, while quipping about the assailant's \"shocking\" death.\n\n===Miami===\nThe story proper begins in United States, with Bond enjoying himself at the [[Fontainebleau Miami Beach]] hotel with a masseuse named [[Dink]]. [[Felix Leiter (Cec Linder)|Felix Leiter]] - Bond's companion from the [[CIA]] - finds Bond and tells he has a message from [[M (Bernard Lee)|M]], forcing Bond to dismiss Dink. Leiter tells that Bond is to keep an eye on Auric Goldfinger, a billionaire industrialist obsessed with gold. As Bond asks Leiter of Goldfinger's whereabouts, Leiter points to Goldfinger arriving right to the scene.\n\nGoldfinger goes to play [[Canasta|gin rummy]] with an acquaintance called [[Simmons]], and as Bond observes the game, he determines that Goldfinger is cheating somehow. Bond goes to the hotel to check Goldfinger's room, finding a beautiful young blonde in her underwear named  [[Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton)|Jill Masterson]]. She is looking through binoculars and relaying Goldfinger the \"hands\" that Simmons has to Goldfinger's earpiece radio. Bond surprises Jill and disrupts Goldfinger's cheating. Without Jill's guidance, Goldfinger loses to Simmons immediately, and despite seeing Goldfinger snap a pen in anger, Jill agrees to a romance with Bond.\n\nBond and Jill consummate their new relationship in the former's suite. While searching the refrigerator for a bottle of 1953 Dom Pérignon, Bond gets knocked unconscious by a mystery assailant (later revealed to be [[Oddjob (Harold Sakata)|Oddjob]]) and after Bond regains consciousness, he goes to find Jill dead, covered in gold paint.\n\n===England===\nBack in [[London]], Bond is initially reprimanded by M. He claims that Bond neglected his duties and was only spared arrest in Miami because Felix Leiter stood up for him. M warns that 008 will take over if Bond doesn't get his act together, with Bond vowing to do better. M appoints Bond to continue the Goldfinger investigation, and is briefed by M and [[Colonel Smithers]] from the Bank of England. \n\nThey believe Goldfinger is endangering the international monetary system through suspected illegal gold smuggling and Bond is assigned to find out how he does so. Bond is provided a WWII-era gold bar with Nazi markings to try goad Goldfinger. Bond then visits the [[Q-branch]], where [[Q]] introduces Bond to his new gadgets,  including two tracking devices and an [[Aston Martin DB5]] with built-in machine guns, smoke grenade launchers and an ejector seat, amongst other extras.\n\n[[File:JamesBondAuricGoldfingerPlayingGolf.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Golf game between Bond and Goldfinger.]]\nBond goes the [[Royal St. George’s Golf Course]], where he finds Goldfinger once again. After getting acquainted a bit, Bond encounters [[Oddjob (Harold Sakata)|Oddjob]], Goldfinger's Korean manservant and caddie for the game. Bond - with a man called [[Hawker (Gerry Duggan)|Hawker]] acting as Bond's caddie - and Goldfinger play a game of golf, with Goldfinger starting to inquire early on why Bond wants to see him. Bond presents the gold bar, which Goldfinger identifies and turns it to a wager for the game.\n\nHe foils Goldfinger's cheating (although by switching the ball, he was cheating himself), and Goldfinger has to pay Bond. After the game, Goldfinger warns Bond not to cross his path a third time. To emphasize his point, he orders a demonstration of Oddjob's skills; with the Korean throwing his [[Razor-Rimmed Hat|hat]] which cuts the head off a stone statue, then he crushes a golf ball in the palm of his hand. Bond then covertly installs a homing device on Goldfinger's [[Rolls-Royce Phantom III]] in order to trail him.\n\n===Switzerland===\nBond follows Goldfinger to [[Switzerland]] - where Goldfinger is heading back to his company - \"Auric Enterprises A.G.\" - in Geneva. While shadowing Goldfinger's Rolls-Royce on his DB5, Bond is passed by a [[Ford Mustang Convertible (1964.5)|white Ford Mustang Convertible]] driven by a woman who is aggressively sounding its horn.\n\nWhen Goldfinger stops to pick up an apple at a bend on the road, Bond stops to observe it. Bond is then shot at, and after seeing the white Mustang leave, Bond pursues. Using gadgets of the DB5, Bond disables the Mustang and goes to help the woman under the pretense that she had a inexplicable accident. Bond offers passage, with the woman being insistent in keeping a box safe. In the car, the woman identifies herself as [[Tilly Masterson (Tania Mallet)|\"Tilly Soames\"]] and she asks Bond to drop her by a nearby gas station.\n\nBond continues the pursuit of Goldfinger and finds his factory. He waits until night-time and begins infiltrating the complex. There, Bond observes gold smuggling on the company premises: namely, how the gold body of Goldfinger's car is dismantled. There, Goldfinger is seen talking to a Chinese man named [[Mr. Ling]], with Goldfinger mentioning something about \"Operation Grand Slam.\"\n\nBond spots a sniper on the hill, and startling the sniper makes her lift her rifle, tripping a alarm wire. Bond discovers the sniper to be Tilly, who Bond assumed tried to kill him at the bend. She says its not the case, as she wants to kill Goldfinger to avenge her sister, whom Bond correctly deduces to be Jill Masterson.\n\nThe security arrives and the two try to escape with Bond's DB5. However, while Masterson tries to flee under Bond's cover fire, Oddjob throws his hat and kills Tilly. Bond feigns surrender and allows an guard to board the DB5, with him to be escorted to Goldfinger. However, Bond pulls a fast one and uses the car's ejection seat function to jettison the guard out. Bond tries to escape the factory, but is ultimately unsuccessful, thanks to a two-way mirror trap at the complex tricking Bond into driving to a brick wall of a building and knocking himself out.\n\n[[File:1964 Goldfinger 20.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Goldfinger about to use his industrial laser on the restrained Bond.]]\nWhen Bond comes to, he finds himself restrained to a gold plate inside Goldfinger's facility. Goldfinger explains his [[Industrial Laser]], his love of gold, and that Bond's \"opposite number\" has identified Bond as a MI6 agent for him. Goldfinger then has the laser activated to kill Bond with it, with Bond's initial questions being met with Goldfinger amusedly retorting that he is expecting Bond to die. \n\nAs such, Bond thinks fast and attempts to bluff to make Goldfinger spare him. He brings up Operation Grandslam and that if he is killed, 008 will continue Bond's mission to bring down Goldfinger. Bond's bluff works, with Goldfinger convinced that Bond is more useful alive, and has [[Kisch]] tranquilize Bond -- losing consciousness yet again.\n\n===Plane flight and Goldfinger's ranch===\n[[File:Bondwiki GoFi64 PGalorePlane1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bond waking up in the presence of Pussy Galore.]]\nUpon reawakening, Bond wakes up to presence of [[Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman)|Pussy Galore]], who informs Bond that he is now aboard Goldfinger's private plane crossing the Atlantic in it to Kentucky. Bond is ordered to get clean, with stewardess [[Mei-Lei]] informing that Bond's equipment has been destroyed in inspection. Going to a bathroom to clean himself up, Bond uses shaving cream to block Mei-Lei from spying in, and as Bond checks everything, he still finds one of the homers in his hidden shoe compartment.\n\nThe plane arrives to Kentucky and Bond is brought to Goldfinger's stud farm, meeting the villain yet again. Afterwards, Bond gets locked in the basement, while Goldfinger meets with gangsters who have provided Goldfinger with the necessary equipment for Operation Grand Slam.\n \nBond manages to escape from his cell and spies the meeting, finding out about Goldfinger's scheme of breaking into the highly secure Fort Knox Federal Reserve with a [[Nerve Gas|lethal chemical agent named \"Delta-9\"]] playing a part in the scheme. All gangsters but [[Mr. Solo]] agree to plan, with Solo guided out of the room. Then, Bond ends captured again by Pussy, all while [[Kisch]] has all the gangsters trapped and killed by the nerve gas. \n\nBond tries to have Mr. Solo unknowingly carry a message detailing Operation Grand Slam with the homer, hoping Felix Leiter to apprehend Solo to get the message. However, Bond's plan is unsuccessful, as Oddjob kills Solo and has the car is crushed in a junkyard, with Solo's body still inside.\n\nUnder Felix's watch, Goldfinger invites Bond for a drink to lull the CIA into false sense of security. Bond and Goldfinger talk about the details of Operation Grand Slam. After Bond points to flaws in the plan, Goldfinger then conveys that his plan is to irradiate the American gold stockpile secured at the Fort Knox depot with an [[Atomic Bomb|\"particularly dirty\" atomic device]] supplied by [[Mr. Ling]] on behalf of Red China. This bomb will render the gold stockpile unusable for 58 years, greatly increasing the value of the gold held by Goldfinger. The resulting economic crisis in the West will also give China additional benefits. Bond goes into the Stables with Pussy Galore where Bond tries to seduce Pussy, but she rejects him, leading to a minor tussle that ends with Bond getting on top of Pussy as she attempts to resist, though she quickly gives in and the two have sex, and Bond begins a relationship with her, convinced that she is unaware of the true objectives of the operation.\n\n===Fort Knox===\nGoldfinger commences Operation Grand Slam, with [[Pussy Galore's Flying Circus]] beginning to disperse the Delta-9 all over the Fort Knox region with their aircraft. It appears every occupant in the area is killed by it, and after using the [[Auric Spectrometer]], the convoy of Goldfinger's henchmen take off gasmasks. The men explode Fort Knox's gates and use the laser to remove the reinforced doors.\n\nGoldfinger and Pussy arrive by a [[UH-12 Helicopter]], bringing the atomic device. Then, at roadside, a geiger counter starts buzzing, with Felix Leiter and the American soldiers getting up; the nerve gas didn't have an effect and the Americans have played possum to lure Goldfinger into a ambush.\n\nGoldfinger has Bond handcuffed to the atomic device and closed inside the vault. But when Goldfinger gloats about Bond's death, the Americans begin their attack against Goldfinger's men. In panic, they make the vault close, trapping [[Kisch]] and Oddjob inside the vault. Kisch - who has the keys to Bond's cuffs - starts to panic and Oddjob throws him down the vault to his death.\n\nGoldfinger carries out his Plan B escape plan, having had a US Army uniform under his jacket. He kills Mr. Ling and US Soldiers to escape aboard the UH-12. Back at the vault, Bond reaches Kisch' key and gets free. Oddjob attacks Bond and fight ensues. During the fight, Bond acquires Oddjob's hat and tries to throw it, only to miss and the hat getting stuck on metal bars. Oddjob goes to retrieve it, when Bond spots a live wire and uses it to electrify the metal bars, with the electricity traveling through the bars and through Oddjob's hat to Oddjob himself, killing him.\n\nTime on the atomic device is running out and Bond attempts to defuse the bomb. Overwhelmed by the complexity of the device's internal workings and little time remaining, Bond almost pulls some wires before the [[Atomic Specialist]] stops him and safely dismantles the device with a flick of a switch. Felix arrives and tells Bond that Pussy switched sides and had helped them change the lethal Delta-9 gas to non-lethal one.\n\n===Goldfinger's last attack===\n[[File:Goldfinger confronting Bond for the last time.png|thumb|right|250px|Goldfinger confronting James Bond for the last time.]]\nAs thanks for stopping the attack on Fort Knox, Bond gets invited to the White House to go meet with the President of the United States. From Godman Army Airfield, Bond takes an United States Air Force C-140 to Washington. But during the flight, an irate-looking Goldfinger appears with [[Goldfinger's Revolver|his revolver]] drawn, while back at the airfield, Felix and others discover the original crew tied up.\n\nIt appears the plane is actually Goldfinger's private Lockheed JetStar, with Goldfinger making his final threats at Bond over the failure of Operation Grand Slam, as well as revealing that the plane is headed to [[Cuba]], where Goldfinger plans to hide from the American authorities. Goldfinger doesn't listen to Bond's warning about the revolver and as Goldfinger answers to Bond's inquiry about Pussy - with Goldfinger reflexively using the revolver to point where she is - Bond grabs onto Goldfinger. The two struggle and soon the revolver is fired, shooting up a window and causing a explosive decompression that sucks Goldfinger out of the plane to his death.\n\nBond reaches the cockpit, with Pussy trying to regain control. As Felix and others observe the plane on the radar, the plane crashes into the ocean, but not before observing some kind of radar blip leaving the plane.\n\nAfterwards, Leiter is flying around in a helicopter trying to find if Bond survived. Pussy Galore tries to wave for a rescue, but Bond stops her and the two romance under the parachutes they escaped with the plane from.",

    "Production": "[[File:Life_Nov_1964.jpg|thumb|250px|''Life Magazine'', November 6th 1964]]\nWith the [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|court case]] between [[Kevin McClory]] and Fleming surrounding ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'' still in the High Courts, producers [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and Harry Saltzman turned to ''Goldfinger'' as the third Bond film. ''Goldfinger'' had what was then considered a large budget of $3 million ($22,480,687 in 2012 dollars), the equivalent of the budgets of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' and ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' combined, and was the first James Bond film classified as a box-office blockbuster. ''Goldfinger'' was chosen with the American cinema market in mind, as the previous films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe.\n\n[[Terence Young]], who directed the previous two films, chose to film ''[[wikipedia:The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders|The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders]]'' instead, after a pay dispute that saw him denied a percentage of the film’s profits. Broccoli and Saltzman turned instead to Guy Hamilton to direct; Hamilton, who had turned down directing ''Dr. No'', felt that he needed to make Bond less of a \"superman\" by making the villains seem more powerful. Hamilton knew Fleming, as both were involved during intelligence matters in the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]]. ''Goldfinger'' saw the return of two crew members who were not involved with ''From Russia with Love'': stunt coordinator [[Bob Simmons]] and production designer [[Ken Adam]]. Both played crucial roles in the development of ''Goldfinger'', with Simmons choreographing the fight sequence between Bond and Oddjob in the vault of Fort Knox, which was not just seen as one of the best Bond fights, but also \"must stand as one of the great cinematic combats\" whilst Adam's efforts on ''Goldfinger'' were \"luxuriantly baroque\" and have resulted in the film being called \"one of his finest pieces of work.\"\n\n===Writing===\nRichard Maibaum, who wrote the previous films, returned to adapt the seventh James Bond novel. Maibaum fixed the novel's heavily criticized plot hole, where Goldfinger actually attempts to empty Fort Knox. In the film, Bond notes it would take twelve days for Goldfinger to steal the gold, before the villain reveals he actually intends to irradiate it with the then topical concept of a [[wikipedia:596 (nuclear test)|Red Chinese atomic bomb]]. Minus this and the change of the buzz saw by a laser, Maibaum's first drafts were very close to the novel, even including at one point Bond and Tilly acting as Goldfinger's secretaries.<ref name=\"Scripting007\">{{Cite book|last1=Feutry|first1=Clément|title=Scripting 007: Behind the writing of the James Bond movies|date=2024|url=https://www.commander007.net/2024/scripting-007-free-book/}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Harry Saltzman disliked the first draft, and brought in Paul Dehn to revise it. Hamilton said Dehn \"brought out the British side of things\". Connery disliked his draft, so Maibaum returned. Dehn also suggested the pre-credit sequence to be an action scene with no relevance to the actual plot. Wolf Mankowitz, an un-credited screenwriter on ''Dr. No'', suggested the scene where Oddjob puts his car into a car crusher to dispose of a dead body. Berkley Mather also did some uncredited contributions.<ref name=\"Scripting007\" /> Because of the quality of work of Maibaum, Dehn and Mather, the script and outline for ''Goldfinger'' became the blueprint for future Bond films.\n\n===Filming===\n[[wikipedia:Principal photography|Principal photography]] on ''Goldfinger'' commenced on 20 January 1964 in [[wikipedia:Miami|Miami, Florida]], at the [[wikipedia:Fontainebleau_Miami_Beach|Fontainebleau Hotel]]; the crew was small, consisting only of Hamilton, Broccoli, Adam, and cinematographer [[Ted Moore]]. Sean Connery never travelled to Florida to film ''Goldfinger'' because he was filming ''[[wikipedia:Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' elsewhere in the US.  Back projection methods were used to insert Connery into the exterior hotel scenes.  Miami also served as location to the scenes involving Felix's pursuit of Oddjob, including the junkyard where Mr Solo's corpse is disposed of in the car crusher.  After five days in Florida, production moved to England. The primary location was [[Pinewood Studios]], home to among other sets, a recreation of the Fontainebleau, the South American city of the pre-title sequence, and both Goldfinger's estate and factory. Three places near the studio were used, Black Park for the car chase involving Bond's Aston Martin and Goldfinger's henchmen inside the factory complex, RAF Northolt for the American airports, and Stoke Park Club for the golf club scene. London Southend Airport was used for the scene where Goldfinger flies to Switzerland. Ian Fleming visited the set of ''Goldfinger'' in April 1964; he died a few months later in August 1964, shortly before the film's release. The second unit filmed in Kentucky, and these shots were edited into scenes filmed at Pinewood. Principal photography then moved to [[Switzerland]], with the car chase being filmed at the small curves roads near Realp, the exterior of the Pilatus Aircraft factory in Stans serving as Goldfinger's factory, and Tilly Masterson's attempt to snipe Goldfinger being shot in the Furka pass. Filming wrapped on 11 July at Andermatt, after nineteen weeks of shooting. Just three weeks prior to the film's release, Hamilton and a small team, which included Broccoli's stepson and future producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] as assistant director, went for last minute shoots in Kentucky. Extra people were hired for post-production issues such as dubbing so the film could be finished in time.\n\nBroccoli earned permission to film in the Fort Knox area with the help of his friend, Lt. Colonel Charles Russhon. To shoot Pussy Galore's Flying Circus gassing the soldiers, the pilots were only allowed to fly above 3000 feet. Hamilton recalled this was \"hopeless\", and they flew at about 500 feet, \"and the military went absolutely ape\". The scenes of people fainting involved the same set of soldiers moving to different locations. For security reasons, the filmmakers were not allowed to film inside the [[wikipedia:United States Bullion Depository|United States Bullion Depository]], although exterior photography was permitted. All sets for the interiors of the building were designed and built from scratch at Pinewood Studios. The filmmakers had no clue as to what the interior of the depository looked like, so [[Ken Adam]]'s imagination provided the idea of gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars. Saltzman disliked the design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built. The controller of Fort Knox later sent a letter to Adam and the production team, complimenting them on their imaginative depiction of the vault. United Artists even had irate letters from people wondering \"how could a British film unit be allowed inside Fort Knox?\" Adam recalled, \"In the end I was pleased that I wasn't allowed into Fort Knox, because it allowed me to do whatever I wanted.\" Another element which was original was the atomic device, to which Hamilton requested the special effects crew to get inventive instead of realistic. Technician Bert Luxford described the end result as looking like an \"engineering work\", with a spinning engine, a chronometer and other decorative pieces.\n\n\n===Effects===\nHamilton remarked, \"Before ''Goldfinger'', gadgets were not really a part of Bond's world.\" Production designer [[Ken Adam]] chose the DB5 because it was the latest version of the [[Aston Martin]] (in the novel Bond drove an [[Aston Martin DB Mark III|DB Mk.III]]), which he considered England's most sophisticated car. The company was initially reluctant, but were finally convinced to a product placement deal. In the script, the car was only armed with smoke screen, but every crew member began suggesting gadgets to install in it: Hamilton conceived the revolving license plate because he had been getting lots of parking tickets, while his stepson suggested the ejector seat (which he saw on television). A gadget near the lights that would drop sharp nails was replaced with an oil dispenser because the producers thought the original could be easily copied by viewers - although this basic idea ''did'' eventually get used in Bond's [[BMW 750iL]] in ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies (film)|Tomorrow Never Dies]]''. Adam and engineer John Stears overhauled the prototype of the Aston Martin DB5 coupe, installing these and other features into a car over six weeks. The scene where the DB5 crashes was filmed twice, with the second take being used in the film. The first take, in which the car drives through the fake wall, can be seen in the trailer. Two of the gadgets were not installed in the car: the wheel-destroying spikes, inspired by ''[[wikipedia:Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'''s scythed chariots, were entirely made on studio; and the ejector seat used a seat thrown by compressed air, with a dummy sat atop it. Another car without the gadgets was created, which was eventually furnished for publicity purposes. It was reused for ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''.\n\nLasers did not exist in 1959 when the book was written, nor did high-power industrial lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a circular saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel more fresh. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken Adam was advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in ''Dr No''. The laser beam itself was an optical effect added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath the table Bond was strapped to.\n\nThe opening credit sequence was designed by graphic artist Robert Brownjohn, featuring clips of all James Bond films thus far projected on Margaret Nolan's body. Its design was inspired by seeing light projecting on people's bodies as they got up and left a cinema.\n\nVisually, the film uses many golden motifs to parallel the gold's symbolic treatment in the novel. All of Goldfinger's female henchwomen in the film except his private jet's co-pilot (black hair) and stewardess (who is Korean) are red-blonde, or blonde, including Pussy Galore and her Flying Circus crew (both the characters Tilly Masterson and Pussy specifically have black hair in the novel). Goldfinger has a yellow-painted Rolls-Royce, and also sports yellow or golden items or clothing in every film scene, including a golden pistol, when disguised as a colonel. Bond is bound to a solid gold table (as Goldfinger points out to him) before nearly being lasered. Goldfinger's factory henchmen in the film wear yellow sashes, Pussy Galore at one point wears a metallic gold vest, and Pussy's pilots all wear yellow sunburst insignia on their uniforms. \"The color gold seems to persuade every scene, giving it a distinct motif that the other films have lacked\". The concept of the recurring gold theme running through the film was a design aspect conceived and executed by Ken Adam and Art Director Peter Murton.\n\nThe model jet used for wide shots of Goldfinger's [[wikipedia:Lockheed JetStar|Lockheed JetStar]] was refurbished to be used as the presidential plane that crashes at the film's end. Several cars were provided by [[Ford|The Ford Motor Company]] including a [[wikipedia:Ford Mustang|Mustang]] that Tilly Masterson drives, a Ford Country Squire station wagon used to transport Bond from the airport to the stud ranch, a [[wikipedia:Ford Thunderbird|Ford Thunderbird]] driven by Felix Leiter, and a [[wikipedia:Lincoln_Continental#Fourth generation (1961–1969)|Lincoln Continental]] in which Oddjob kills Solo. The Continental had its engine removed before being placed in a car crusher, and the destroyed car had to be partially cut so the [[wikipedia:Ford_Ranchero#1960–1965 Falcon Ranchero|Ford Falcon Ranchero]] pick-up truck on which it is deposited could support the weight. The actual soundtrack of the car being compacted was deemed unusable; this was later dubbed during post production - sound editor Norman Wanstall used multiple overdubs of beer cans being crushed in a bucket to simulate the sound of the car being crushed, whilst the baling machine itself was replicated by recording the sound of an air compressor that was being used by road workers repairing the parking lot at Pinewood Studios.\n\nThe crushed car cube seen in the back of the Ford Ranchero when it returns to Goldfinger's ranch was not the same one produced by the crushing machine in the earlier sequence (which was filmed in the United States).  As the ranch scenes were filmed in the Pinewood backlot, few British scrapyards owned a similar machine that could produce an identical looking cube of compacted metal, and a prop had to be substituted as a result.\n\n===Music===\n: ''Main article: [[Goldfinger (soundtrack)]]''\n\nSince the release date for the film had been pre-determined and filming had finished close to that date, [[John Barry]] received some edits directly from the cutting room floor, rather than as a finished edit, and scored some sequences from the rough, initial prints. Barry described his work in ''Goldfinger'' as a favourite of his, saying it was \"the first time I had complete control, writing the score and the song\". The musical tracks, in keeping with the film's theme of gold and metal, make heavy use of brass, and also metallic chimes. The film's score is described as \"brassy and raunchy\" with \"a sassy sexiness to it\".\n\n''Goldfinger'' is said to have started the tradition of Bond theme songs being from the pop genre or using popular artists, although this had already been done with Matt Monro singing the title song of ''From Russia with Love''. [[Shirley Bassey]] sang the theme song \"Goldfinger\", and she would go on to sing the theme songs for two other Bond films, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' and ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''. The song was composed by John Barry, with lyrics by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse that were described in one contemporary newspaper as \"puerile\". Newley himself recorded the early versions, which were even considered for inclusion in the film. The [[Goldfinger (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] topped the [[wikipedia:Billboard 200|Billboard 200]] chart, and reached the 14th place in the [[wikipedia:UK Albums Chart|UK Albums Chart]]. The single for \"Goldfinger\" was also successful, going 8th at the [[wikipedia:Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Hot 100]], and 21st in the [[wikipedia:UK Singles Chart|UK charts]].",

    "Trivia": "===Asphyxiation argument===\n[[File:Goldfinger_Golden-girl.jpg|thumb|260px]]Although James Bond films are not known for their technical accuracy, but rather for outlandishly plausible action, one incident in this film bears mentioning.\n\nIn one scene, the villain's girlfriend, Jill Masterson, is murdered by \"skin suffocation.\" She was painted with gold paint and died, because her skin was unable to breathe. According to urban legend, the concept was based on the death of Swiss fashion model who painted herself and asphyxiated.\n\nThough this is a plausible explanation for this unusual method of killing, it has been argued whether or not it is possible. Humans, being mammals, achieve respiration via their mouths and nostrils to fill their lungs with air. The only animals that breathe through their skin are insects and worms. In fact, were it true that people breathe, in auxiliary fashion, through their skin, it would, therefore, be impossible for people to engage in extended bathing, mud baths, scuba diving and, indeed, body painting - activities requiring extended covering of the skin. If one did try murder via gilding, the victim would die of heat stroke, but only after a long period and not in the manner shown in the movie. The gold paint would clog the pores and prevent perspiration, rendering the body unable to properly regulate its temperature. Dying in this fashion, however, would take several days and is a very inefficient manner of killing.\n\nThe Discovery Channel series, ''MythBusters'' has twice attempted to prove or disprove whether skin suffocation due to paint was possible. In both experiments one of the hosts of the series was covered head-to-toe in gold paint. The first experiment was called off when the subject began experiencing breathing and blood pressure problems. In a follow-up experiment, a different subject was covered but this time showed no ill effects. Shirley Eaton herself appeared on one of the ''MythBusters'' installments, in the process debunking a related myth that she had died during the filming of ''Goldfinger'' of skin suffocation from being painted gold for the scene.\n\n===Other Trivia===\n*The villain's name was borrowed from the architect Ernö Goldfinger, and his character bears some resemblance. Ernö Goldfinger consulted his lawyers when the book was published, prompting Fleming to suggest renaming the character \"Goldprick\", but eventually settled out of court in return for his costs, six copies of the book, and an agreement that the characters' first name Auric would always be used.\n*The film's opening teaser sequence is based on the novel's opening where Bond is in the Miami Airport lounge thinking about the recent killing of a drug smuggler.\n*The character \"Pussy Galore\" was named after Ian Fleming's pet octopus.\n*This is the first James Bond film where the pre-title sequence has a storyline unrelated to the film's main plot and never being referred later afterwards. The same thing would occur later in ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' and ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]''.\n*Concerned about censors, the film's producers thought about changing Pussy Galore's name to \"Kitty Galore\". They kept the original name when British newspapers began to refer to Honor Blackman as \"Pussy\" in the lead up to production.\n*First of five James Bond films that win an Academy Award. It won for Best Sound Editing. \n*Ian Fleming also contributed to the original draft screenplay for ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' television series, in which one of the heroes was named \"Napoleon Solo\". That name originally came from the novel: Napoleon Solo is one of the crime bosses Goldfinger invites to participate in his scheme to steal the gold from Fort Knox, however, the character appearing in the film is a gangster referred to only as \"Mr. Solo\" (coincidentally a working title for ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.''), he exits the story due to \"a pressing engagement.\"\n*First James Bond film to show Bond wearing dinner suit twice in separate occasions, with different colors of jacket in each moments. This would be repeated in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (where he wears, in fact, three different colors of dinner suits), ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'' and ''[[A View to a Kill (film)|A View to a Kill]]''.\n*Ford supplied the Lincoln Continental which is unceremoniously crushed in a junkyard compactor (causing much anger among American audiences) in return for the all-new Ford Mustang being showcased in the Swiss mountain driving sequence.\n*During a test screening of the car crusher scene, the projectionist stopped showing the footage and angrily confronted director Guy Hamilton over the destruction of the Lincoln Continental - at the time an expensive and desirable vehicle in the United States.\n*In the end sequence, when the atomic bomb is defused, the original ending countdown shown was \"003\" seconds remaining to detonation. When the film was released in the U.S., the producers changed it to 007 seconds, but the dialogue line remained: \"Three more ticks and Mr. Goldfinger would have hit the jackpot\".\n*For an unknown reason Jill and Tilly's surname was changed from Masterton to Masterson for the film.\n*First James Bond film to refer the President of the United States and to show American mafiosi.\n*The gold-painted girl in the opening credits is actually Margaret Nolan who also plays Bond's Miami masseuse, [[Dink]].\n*Sean Connery never traveled to the United States to film this movie. Every scene where Bond is in America was shot at Pinewood Studios in London.\n*For security reasons, the filmmakers were not allowed to film inside Fort Knox depository. All sets for the interior of Fort Knox were designed and built from scratch.\n*In scenes inside the Fort Knox military base, the US soldiers are primarily armed with the then-standard issue M14 rifles but in the scenes inside and right outside the depository, they are armed with World War II-era weapons. This is because scenes in the base were filmed in the real Fort Knox, with the soldiers played by real soldiers with their real weapons, while the scenes at and inside the depository were filmed on a set in England, where M14s were not available.\n*The 3D map Goldfinger used during his mission briefing is now on display at Fort Knox.\n*Bond is not a fan of those other British 1960s icons [[The Beatles]]. He tells Jill Masterson that they should not be listened to without earmuffs. [[Richard Vernon]], who played Colonel Smithers in ''Goldfinger'', also appeared in The Beatles' first film [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Day%27s_Night_(film) ''A Hard Day's Night''], as a train passenger who is visibly irritated with the band's mischievous attitudes. [[Margaret Nolan]], the actress of [[Dink]] the Miami Hotel masseuse in ''Goldfinger'' who also appeared in the opening credits as the \"golden girl\", made an appearance as well in ''A Hard Day's Night'' as a casino regular, briefly escorted [[Paul McCartney & Wings|Paul McCartney]]'s grandfather. Coincidentally, The Beatles' first record \"[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Me_Do Love Me Do]\" and James Bond cinematic debut [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']] were released on the same date: October 5, 1962. Ironically, one of the Beatles, Paul McCartney, would later do the [[Live and Let Die (song)|theme song]] for [[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]].\n*Script co-writer Paul Dehn would later be hired to write most of the entries in the ''Planet of the Apes'' film franchise, in part due to his work on ''Goldfinger''.\n*Although the car crushing sequence was filmed in a junkyard in Miami, the scene where Oddjob returns with the cubed remains of the Lincoln Continental were shot at Pinewood.  The production team struggled to locate a scrapyard in the UK that owned a  similar baling press which could produce a suitable stand-in prop, as such machines were still relatively rare outside the USA.  Eventually one was found.\n*Scenes from the film are shown during the opening credits sequence, although footage from the helicopter chase in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' is also featured.\n*The film was temporarily banned in Israel due to Gert Fröbe's connections with the Nazi Party. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a Jewish family publicly thanked Fröbe for protecting them from persecution during [[World War II]].\n*Gert Fröbe was chosen for the villain's role because producers Saltzman and Broccoli had happened to see his performance in a German thriller named 'Es geschah am hellichten Tag' ('It happened in broad daylight', 1958), which is based on the story ''Das Versprechen'' (literally ''The Pledge'') by Friedrich Dürrenmatt. In that movie, Fröbe performed the role of a psychopathic serial killer named Schrott, who lets out his frustrations about his overly dominating wife on helpless children.\n*The iconic slow aerial shot that follows the opening credits is that of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, which still stands. The big band piece accompanying that is John Barry's \"Into Miami.\"\n*For many years, ABC's broadcasts of ''Goldfinger'' in the United States omitted the film's pre-credits sequence, going straight from the gunbarrel to the opening credits.\n*In addition to the skin suffocation implausibility, another debatable issue involves Goldfinger's plan to render the Fort Knox gold supply radioactive for nearly 60 years by detonating a small but dirty nuclear bomb inside the facility. Even a small nuclear device, however, would have been more likely to physically destroy the gold rather than simply irradiate it (this being ironically a better outcome for Goldfinger's desire to corner the gold market).\n*This was one of if not the first major films to reference the concept of a \"dirty bomb\" - a low-yield nuclear device designed to spread radioactive material.\n*Assuming Goldfinger's calculations were correct and the gold wasn't vaporized by the explosion outright, in theory the gold at Fort Knox would have become accessible again in 2022.",

According to urban legend, the concept was based on the death of Swiss fashion model who painted herself and asphyxiated.\n\nThough this is a plausible explanation for this unusual method of killing, it has been argued whether or not it is possible. Humans, being mammals, achieve respiration via their mouths and nostrils to fill their lungs with air. The only animals that breathe through their skin are insects and worms. In fact, were it true that people breathe, in auxiliary fashion, through their skin, it would, therefore, be impossible for people to engage in extended bathing, mud baths, scuba diving and, indeed, body painting - activities requiring extended covering of the skin. If one did try murder via gilding, the victim would die of heat stroke, but only after a long period and not in the manner shown in the movie. The gold paint would clog the pores and prevent perspiration, rendering the body unable to properly regulate its temperature. Dying in this fashion, however, would take several days and is a very inefficient manner of killing.\n\nThe Discovery Channel series, ''MythBusters'' has twice attempted to prove or disprove whether skin suffocation due to paint was possible. In both experiments one of the hosts of the series was covered head-to-toe in gold paint. The first experiment was called off when the subject began experiencing breathing and blood pressure problems. In a follow-up experiment, a different subject was covered but this time showed no ill effects. Shirley Eaton herself appeared on one of the ''MythBusters'' installments, in the process debunking a related myth that she had died during the filming of ''Goldfinger'' of skin suffocation from being painted gold for the scene.",
    "Other Trivia": "*The villain's name was borrowed from the architect Ernö Goldfinger, and his character bears some resemblance. Ernö Goldfinger consulted his lawyers when the book was published, prompting Fleming to suggest renaming the character \"Goldprick\", but eventually settled out of court in return for his costs, six copies of the book, and an agreement that the characters' first name Auric would always be used.\n*The film's opening teaser sequence is based on the novel's opening where Bond is in the Miami Airport lounge thinking about the recent killing of a drug smuggler.\n*The character \"Pussy Galore\" was named after Ian Fleming's pet octopus.\n*This is the first James Bond film where the pre-title sequence has a storyline unrelated to the film's main plot and never being referred later afterwards. The same thing would occur later in ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' and ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]''.\n*Concerned about censors, the film's producers thought about changing Pussy Galore's name to \"Kitty Galore\". They kept the original name when British newspapers began to refer to Honor Blackman as \"Pussy\" in the lead up to production.\n*First of five James Bond films that win an Academy Award. It won for Best Sound Editing. \n*Ian Fleming also contributed to the original draft screenplay for ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' television series, in which one of the heroes was named \"Napoleon Solo\". That name originally came from the novel: Napoleon Solo is one of the crime bosses Goldfinger invites to participate in his scheme to steal the gold from Fort Knox, however, the character appearing in the film is a gangster referred to only as \"Mr. Solo\" (coincidentally a working title for ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.''), he exits the story due to \"a pressing engagement.\"\n*First James Bond film to show Bond wearing dinner suit twice in separate occasions, with different colors of jacket in each moments. This would be repeated in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (where he wears, in fact, three different colors of dinner suits), ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'' and ''[[A View to a Kill (film)|A View to a Kill]]''.\n*Ford supplied the Lincoln Continental which is unceremoniously crushed in a junkyard compactor (causing much anger among American audiences) in return for the all-new Ford Mustang being showcased in the Swiss mountain driving sequence.\n*During a test screening of the car crusher scene, the projectionist stopped showing the footage and angrily confronted director Guy Hamilton over the destruction of the Lincoln Continental - at the time an expensive and desirable vehicle in the United States.\n*In the end sequence, when the atomic bomb is defused, the original ending countdown shown was \"003\" seconds remaining to detonation. When the film was released in the U.S., the producers changed it to 007 seconds, but the dialogue line remained: \"Three more ticks and Mr. Goldfinger would have hit the jackpot\".\n*For an unknown reason Jill and Tilly's surname was changed from Masterton to Masterson for the film.\n*First James Bond film to refer the President of the United States and to show American mafiosi.\n*The gold-painted girl in the opening credits is actually Margaret Nolan who also plays Bond's Miami masseuse, [[Dink]].\n*Sean Connery never traveled to the United States to film this movie. Every scene where Bond is in America was shot at Pinewood Studios in London.\n*For security reasons, the filmmakers were not allowed to film inside Fort Knox depository. All sets for the interior of Fort Knox were designed and built from scratch.\n*In scenes inside the Fort Knox military base, the US soldiers are primarily armed with the then-standard issue M14 rifles but in the scenes inside and right outside the depository, they are armed with World War II-era weapons. This is because scenes in the base were filmed in the real Fort Knox, with the soldiers played by real soldiers with their real weapons, while the scenes at and inside the depository were filmed on a set in England, where M14s were not available.\n*The 3D map Goldfinger used during his mission briefing is now on display at Fort Knox.\n*Bond is not a fan of those other British 1960s icons [[The Beatles]]. He tells Jill Masterson that they should not be listened to without earmuffs. [[Richard Vernon]], who played Colonel Smithers in ''Goldfinger'', also appeared in The Beatles' first film [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Day%27s_Night_(film) ''A Hard Day's Night''], as a train passenger who is visibly irritated with the band's mischievous attitudes. [[Margaret Nolan]], the actress of [[Dink]] the Miami Hotel masseuse in ''Goldfinger'' who also appeared in the opening credits as the \"golden girl\", made an appearance as well in ''A Hard Day's Night'' as a casino regular, briefly escorted [[Paul McCartney & Wings|Paul McCartney]]'s grandfather. Coincidentally, The Beatles' first record \"[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Me_Do Love Me Do]\" and James Bond cinematic debut [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']] were released on the same date: October 5, 1962. Ironically, one of the Beatles, Paul McCartney, would later do the [[Live and Let Die (song)|theme song]] for [[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]].\n*Script co-writer Paul Dehn would later be hired to write most of the entries in the ''Planet of the Apes'' film franchise, in part due to his work on ''Goldfinger''.\n*Although the car crushing sequence was filmed in a junkyard in Miami, the scene where Oddjob returns with the cubed remains of the Lincoln Continental were shot at Pinewood.  The production team struggled to locate a scrapyard in the UK that owned a  similar baling press which could produce a suitable stand-in prop, as such machines were still relatively rare outside the USA.  Eventually one was found.\n*Scenes from the film are shown during the opening credits sequence, although footage from the helicopter chase in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' is also featured.\n*The film was temporarily banned in Israel due to Gert Fröbe's connections with the Nazi Party. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a Jewish family publicly thanked Fröbe for protecting them from persecution during [[World War II]].\n*Gert Fröbe was chosen for the villain's role because producers Saltzman and Broccoli had happened to see his performance in a German thriller named 'Es geschah am hellichten Tag' ('It happened in broad daylight', 1958), which is based on the story ''Das Versprechen'' (literally ''The Pledge'') by Friedrich Dürrenmatt. In that movie, Fröbe performed the role of a psychopathic serial killer named Schrott, who lets out his frustrations about his overly dominating wife on helpless children.\n*The iconic slow aerial shot that follows the opening credits is that of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, which still stands. The big band piece accompanying that is John Barry's \"Into Miami.\"\n*For many years, ABC's broadcasts of ''Goldfinger'' in the United States omitted the film's pre-credits sequence, going straight from the gunbarrel to the opening credits.\n*In addition to the skin suffocation implausibility, another debatable issue involves Goldfinger's plan to render the Fort Knox gold supply radioactive for nearly 60 years by detonating a small but dirty nuclear bomb inside the facility. Even a small nuclear device, however, would have been more likely to physically destroy the gold rather than simply irradiate it (this being ironically a better outcome for Goldfinger's desire to corner the gold market).\n*This was one of if not the first major films to reference the concept of a \"dirty bomb\" - a low-yield nuclear device designed to spread radioactive material.\n*Assuming Goldfinger's calculations were correct and the gold wasn't vaporized by the explosion outright, in theory the gold at Fort Knox would have become accessible again in 2022.",
