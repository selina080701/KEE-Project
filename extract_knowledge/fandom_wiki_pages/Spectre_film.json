So long!|[[Mr. White]] to [[James Bond (Daniel Craig)|James Bond]]|Spectre (film)}}\n'''''Spectre''''' is a 2015 spy film and the twenty-fourth film in the ''[[James Bond films|James Bond]]'' [[James Bond films|series]] produced by [[EON Productions]]. Like the previous film ''[[Skyfall (film)|Skyfall]]'', ''Spectre'' was written by [[John Logan]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis]] and [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Robert Wade]] is directed by [[Sam Mendes]] and features [[Daniel Craig]] in his fourth performance as James Bond.<ref name=\"officialannouncement\">7/11/13 — [http://www.007.com/bond-24-news-2/ 007.com — Bond 24 news]</ref> The film was released in the UK on 26 October 2015, fifty years after release of ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965), thirty years after release of ''[[A View to a Kill (film)|A View to a Kill]]'' (1985), and twenty years after release of ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]'' (1995), and worldwide on 6 November 2015 in regular and IMAX theatres. It continues a story arc which started in Craig's first three films: ''[[Casino Royale (film)|Casino Royale]]'', ''[[Quantum of Solace (film)|Quantum of Solace]]'', and ''[[Skyfall (film)|Skyfall]]''.\n\nIn the film, a cryptic message from Bond’s past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organization. While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind [[SPECTRE|Spectre]].<ref name=\":1\">12/4/14 — [http://www.007.com/bond-returns-in-spectre/ 007.com — Bond Returns in ''Spectre'']</ref>\n\nThe film's title is derived from the criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]], which was prominent during the original Bond films and several [[Ian Fleming]] novels. The organisation's logo, an octopus, is also referenced in the official teaser poster.",
    "Plot": "===Hunting Spectre===\nDuring the Day of the Dead festival in Mexico City, [[James Bond (Daniel Craig)|James Bond]] kills two men arranging to blow up a stadium, before shooting a briefcase containing their bomb. In doing so, the building they are in explodes and collapses. Bond gives chase to a criminal operative named [[Marco Sciarra (Alessandro Cremona)|Marco Sciarra]], who survived the blast and, in an attempt to escape, boards a helicopter. Bond follows and in the ensuing struggle he throws both Sciarra and the pilot out of the helicopter to their deaths, while in the process, stealing Sciarra's [[SPECTRE Ring|band ring]], which has an octopus symbol on it. Bond's actions are revealed to be him working on the unofficial orders of the previous [[M (Judi Dench)|M]], who told him that if she died, he was to kill Sciarra and attend his funeral. On his return to [[London]], Bond is indefinitely taken off field duty by the current [[M (Ralph Fiennes)|M]], who is in the midst of a power struggle with [[Max Denbigh]] (also known as the code name 'C', assigned to him by Bond), the head of the newly created Joint Intelligence Service, consisting of the recently merged [[MI5]] and [[MI6]]. C also wants to create the \"[[Nine Eyes Committee|Nine Eyes]]\" intelligence co-operation agreement between nine countries, and close down the '00' section in the process.\n\nBond disobeys M's orders and travels to Rome to attend Sciarra's funeral. That evening he visits and seduces Sciarra's widow [[Lucia Sciarra|Lucia]], who tells him about a criminal organization to which her husband belonged and where they are meeting that evening after he rescues her from assassins. Bond enters the meeting by showing the ring, where he sees the head of the organization, in shadow, chairing a meeting, referring to terrorism in Hamburg and Tunisia, as well as Mexico City and distribution of counterfeit pharmaceutical products. The head mentions the events in Mexico, and mentions Bond by name, turning to face him as he does so. Having been recognized, Bond escapes the meeting and a car chase through Rome ensues, with Bond in an [[Aston Martin DB10]] pursued by [[Mr. Hinx]], an assassin for the organization, who drives in a [[Jaguar C-X75]]. [[Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris)|Eve Moneypenny]] acts as a source of information for Bond and informs him that a reference he heard in both Mexico and the meeting will lead to [[Mr. White]], a former member of the [[Quantum]] organization which is revealed to be a subsidiary of this new organization. Bond also asks for a check on the name [[Blofeld (Christoph Waltz)|Franz Oberhauser]], revealed to be the name of the meeting’s chairman, who Bond recognized might be from his past.\n\n===Legacy of the Pale King===\nBond travels to [[Austria]] to find [[Mr. White]] at his current home, and finds him dying of [[Thallium]] radiation poisoning, which was planted on his phone after falling from favor with the organization and its leadership, due to White's reservations about human tracking. Bond wins his trust by disarming himself of his weapon after discovering White has a daughter, [[Madeleine Swann|Dr. Madeleine Swann]], that he is protecting from the organization. Bond promises to protect her from them before White tells him Madeleine can lead him to \"l'Américain\", which will, in turn, lead him to the organization. White then uses Bond's [[Walther PPK|gun]] to shoot himself in the head. Bond finds Swann at the secluded [[Hoffler Klinik (organization)|Austrian clinic]] where she works, but she tries to have him thrown out before she is snatched by Mr. Hinx. Bond chases the kidnappers by plane and forces their cars to crash before he makes his escape with Swann, who is still angry with Bond. The pair then meets with [[Q (Ben Whishaw)|Q]], who reveals that Sciarra's ring contains digital files linking Oberhauser, the leader of the organization, and Bond's [[Casino Royale (film)|three]] [[Quantum of Solace (film)|previous]] [[Skyfall (film)|missions]]. Swann then informs them about the name of the organization, [[SPECTRE|Spectre]], and that l'Américain is a hotel in Tangier, Morocco, not a person, as Bond has suspected previously.\n\n[[File:Spectre_-_Blofeld_tortures_007_(1).jpg|thumb|255px|Oberhauser tortures 007.]]\nThe couple travels to the hotel and stays in the suite her father used to stay in every year since he was married to Swann's [[Mrs. White|mother]]. Bond discovers White had built a secret room full of videotapes, charts, and photographs, as well as maps and coordinates of where they should go next. They travel to the nearest point a train will go, but are again attacked by Mr. Hinx. After fighting and nearly killing them both, Hinx is flung off the train, presumably to his death, by a rope attached to several beer kegs, leading to Swann and Bond having sex. At the end of the journey, they are transported to a [[Saharan Crater Facility|facility]] in the desert, where they are met by and held prisoner by who Bond thinks is Franz Oberhauser, the son of [[Hannes Oberhauser (Film)|Hannes Oberhauser]], Bond's temporary foster father, who was murdered. While drilling into Bond's head and nerves with [[Neurosurgical Chair|mechanical probes]], Oberhauser also informs him that C is part of the Spectre organization, and he feeds all the intelligence data straight to Spectre. Oberhauser then tortures Bond and reveals that the name Franz Oberhauser was what Bond and Hannes called him, but his real name, the name he uses now, is actually Ernst Stavro Blofeld. He secretly renamed himself while Bond stayed with him and he took in his mother’s bloodline. He faked his death thirty-four years ago to be recognized as his real name and to avoid legal trouble after he murdered his father, Hannes; Blofeld reveals that he killed his father because he felt that Bond had replaced him as his father's favorite. Bond and Swann escape with the help of Bond's [[Omega Seamaster|exploding watch]], destroying the facility in the process.\n\n===Loose ends===\nBack in London, Bond and Swann meet M, [[Bill Tanner (Rory Kinnear)|Bill Tanner]], Q, and Moneypenny, and they travel to arrest C and stop the launch of the Nine Eyes program. En route they are ambushed and Bond is kidnapped by Spectre agents. M and the others escape and proceed to wait for C in his office, arrest him and shut down Nine Eyes before it launches; in an ensuing struggle, C falls to his death at the hands of M. Bond, meanwhile, been taken to the old [[SIS Building|MI6 building—derelict]] since [[Raoul Silva]]'s attack in ''Skyfall'', and now scheduled for demolition—but he disables his captors before entering the building. He meets Blofeld - who was ferociously marred by the explosion where Bond escaped earlier on, leaving him with a horrific scar and blindness in one eye - who tells him the building is rigged to explode in three minutes and that Swann is hidden within it, before giving Bond a choice: die in the explosion while rescuing Swann, or leave with his life and be forever haunted by the fact that he did not save her. Bond finds her and the couple escapes by boat out onto the Thames. They chase Blofeld — who is in a helicopter — and shoot it down; the helicopter crashes onto Westminster Bridge. Bond comes close to executing Blofeld but then lets him be arrested by M and leaves with Madeleine. The next day Bond retrieves his old [[Aston Martin DB5]] from Q, now fully repaired, and drives off with Madeleine.",

    " Trivia ": "* For the first time in their shared history, Aston Martin specially commissioned the DB10 specifically just for the film. It was designed and built exclusively for the James Bond Franchise.\n* Director Sam Mendes would later revisit the concept of using a single long tracking shot, as seen in ''Spectre's'' opening sequence, in his Oscar-nominated war film, ''1917'', only extended for an entire movie.\n* [[Kingsley Amis]] receives screen credit due to a plot point and some dialogue having been adapted from his Bond novel, ''[[Colonel Sun]]''. Although ''[[Die Another Day]]'' featured a character whose name referenced that of Amis' titular villain, this was the first film to directly adapt material from the novel; indeed, it is the first Bond film to acknowledge adapting any literary Bond story not written by [[Ian Fleming]].\n* The SPECTRE conference sequence references a similar set-piece event in the original ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'' novel and its [[Thunderball (film)|1965 film adaptation]], with a key difference being that Bond is not present in the earlier version (and, indeed, does not encounter Blofeld at all in ''Thunderball'').\n* This is the only Daniel Craig's Bond film where Bond is seen sporting a white dinner suit.\n* The name Oberhauser comes from the short story ''[[Octopussy and the Living Daylights|Octopussy]]''.\n* The film represents the first appearance of [[Blofeld's cat]] since the non-Eon ''[[Never Say Never Again (film)|Never Say Never Again]]'' or the official ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''.\n* It is stated that a snow team of 30 people worked against the clock for guarantee the snow conditions on the road and in the forest of the movie.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Spectre - Official File |url=hhttps://www.007.com/the-films/spectre/ |website=[[007.com]] |access-date=January 21, 2024 |date=2022 |language=en|archive-date= |archive-url= |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Spectre has a Guinness World Record for the largest explosion on screen (that of Blofeld's lair).",
