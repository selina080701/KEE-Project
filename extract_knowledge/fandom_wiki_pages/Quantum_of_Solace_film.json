The sequel's storyline was created by producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] while 2006's ''[[Casino Royale (film)|Casino Royale]]'' was shooting. [[Paul Haggis]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis]] and [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Robert Wade]] returned as writers. The film was directed by [[Marc Forster]], and features [[Daniel Craig]] in his second performance as [[James Bond (Daniel Craig)|James Bond]]. The film released on October 31, 2008 in the United Kingdom and on November 14, 2008 in the United States.\n\nIn the film, Bond is tracking down the organisation that caused the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd (Eva Green)|Vesper Lynd]]. He comes across a member of the organisation named [[Dominic Greene]] (played by [[Mathieu Amalric]]), who intends to stage a coup d'état in a South American country. Bond is assisted by [[Camille Montes]] (played by [[Olga Kurylenko]]), who also wants revenge for what misdoings Greene did to her family.\n\nThe title was chosen from a short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (book)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' collection and is the last Bond film to be named after a work by Ian Fleming.",
    "Plot": "The film continues immediately after the events of ''[[Casino Royale (film)|Casino Royale]]'', with Bond driving from Lake Garda to Siena, [[Italy]]. With the captured [[Mr. White]] in the boot of [[Aston Martin DBS V12|his car]], Bond is attacked by chasing henchmen. After evading his pursuers, Bond delivers White to [[M (Judi Dench) (modern continuity)|M]], who debriefs him on a body that was found on a beach and is assumed to be that of [[Vesper Lynd (Eva Green)|Vesper Lynd]]'s lover, [[Yusef Kabira]]. M also questions Bond as to his mental state, particularly since she suspects he may be seeking revenge on those who killed Vesper. Bond tells her she doesn't matter to him any longer.  M interrogates White regarding his organisation, [[Quantum]]. M's bodyguard, [[Craig Mitchell]], is revealed as a double agent and a traitor, attacking M and allowing White to escape; Bond chases Mitchell across Siena and kills him. Following a forensic investigation into Mitchell's apartment, Bond heads to Haiti to track down Mitchell's contact, assassin [[Edmund Slate]]. In carrying out his objective, Bond kills slate (infuriating M) but he learns that Slate was sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] at the behest of her lover, [[Dominic Greene]], the chairman of an ecological organisation called [[Greene Planet]]. While observing her meeting with Greene, Bond learns that Greene is helping the Bolivian [[General Medrano]] ; who murdered Camille's family ; overthrow his government in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\nGreene has Camille escorted away on Medrano's boat to \"sweeten\" their deal, but Bond rescues her. Bond then follows Greene to a private jet, which flies him to a performance of the opera ''Tosca'' at Lake Constance, [[Austria]]. After subduing a [[Quantum Member (Christian Heller)|Quantum member]] and stealing his earpiece, Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, and a gunfight ensues in a restaurant. A [[Haines' Bodyguard|bodyguard]] of [[Guy Haines]], an adviser to the British Prime Minister, is shot dead and thrown off the [[Bregenz Opera House|opera house]]'s roof, and M, assuming Bond is the killer, has his passports and credit cards revoked. Bond travels to Italy to reunite with his old ally [[René Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini)|René Mathis]], whom he convinces to accompany him to La Paz. They are greeted by the jobsworth [[Strawberry Fields]], an MI6 field operative from the British Consulate, who demands that Bond return to the [[United Kingdom]] on the next available flight. Bond disobeys and seduces her in their hotel suite.\n\nBond meets Camille again at a fund-raiser being held by Greene, and they leave hastily together, but are pulled over by the Bolivian police. The police order Bond to open the luggage compartment of his vehicle, revealing a bloodied Mathis. As Bond lifts Mathis out of the vehicle, the policemen open fire and fatally wound Mathis, who dies in Bond's arms. After Bond subdues the police and deposits Mathis' body in a waste container, 007 and Camille drive to Greene's intended land acquisition and survey the area in a Douglas DC-3 plane. They are intercepted and shot down by an Aermacchi SF.260 fighter and a Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter. They escape from the crippled plane by parachuting, landing in a sinkhole. While escaping the cave, Bond and Camille discover Quantum is blockading Bolivia's supply of fresh water, normally flowing in subterranean rivers, by damming it.\n\n[[File:The_death_of_Strawberry_Fields.png|thumb|250px|The death of Strawberry Fields.]]\nThe duo return to La Paz, where Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in crude oil, an apparent reference to [[Oddjob (Harold Sakata)|Oddjob]]'s murder of [[Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton)|Jill Masterson]] in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''. Believing that Bond has become a threat to both friend and foe, M orders him to disarm and end his activities in Bolivia, but he defies her once again, overpowers his captors and escapes. Bond meets [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent [[Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright)|Felix Leiter]] at a local bar, who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet at an [[Perla de las Dunas|eco-hotel]] in the Bolivian desert. Tipped off by Leiter, Bond evades American Special Forces attempting to kill him.\n\nBond then sets out to the hotel, where Greene and Medrano make the change in the Bolivian leadership. Bond kills the departing [[Carlos (Fernando Guillen Cuervo)|Colonel of Police]] for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the complex. In the process, he sets off a chain of explosions in the hotel when a hydrogen fuel tank is hit by an out-of-control vehicle. Camille kills Medrano, avenging the deaths of her family, and Bond captures Greene. After interrogating him, he leaves Greene stranded in the middle of the desert with nothing but a can of motor oil to drink. Bond drives Camille to a train station, where they kiss before she departs.\n\nBond goes to Kazan, [[Russia]], where he confronts Yusef Kabira. Kabira is actually a member of Quantum who seduces high-ranking women with valuable connections, getting them to give up government assets as ransom for himself in fake kidnappings where he is supposedly held hostage. He is attempting to do the same with [[Canada|Canadian]] agent [[Corinne Veneau]], even giving her the same kind of necklace he gave Vesper. Surprising them at Yusef's apartment, Bond tells Corinne about Vesper and advises her to alert the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, which she does. As Bond is leaving Yusef's apartment he is confronted by M, who is surprised that Bond did not kill Yusef, but rather left him alive for questioning. M reveals that Leiter has been promoted at the CIA, and that Greene was found in the desert, shot dead and with motor oil in his stomach. Bond doesn't volunteer any information on Greene, but tells M that she was right about Vesper. M then tells Bond that MI6 needs him and fully reinstates him as an agent. Bond walks off into the night, telling M that he never left. As he leaves, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.",

He felt Bond had been humanized in that film, explaining, \"People travel a lot more now, and with the Internet they’re more aware of what the rest of the world is like.

    "Reception": "Reaction to ''Quantum of Solace'' was mixed among critics. The film holds a 64% rating, based on 244 reviews, on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus, \"Brutal and breathless, ''Quantum of Solace'' delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming on the heels of ''Casino Royale'', it's still a bit of a disappointment.\" The film holds an average score of 58 out of 100 on Metacritic, signifying \"mixed or average reviews\". [[Roger Moore]], who praised Daniel Craig's performance in ''Casino Royale'', continued to feel Craig was a \"damn good Bond but the film as a whole, there was a bit too much flash cutting [and] it was just like a commercial of the action.\" \n\n''The Guardian'' said the film \"isn't as good as ''Casino Royale'': the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up.\" Many viewers criticised the title choice of ''Quantum of Solace''.\n\nWell-respected film critic Roger Ebert of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' disliked the film after praising ''Casino Royale''. He said the plot was mediocre, characters weak and that Bond lacked his usual personality. He did, however, praise Craig's interpretation of the role. Many critics and fans also noted the similarity between the plot of ''Quantum'' and the [[Timothy Dalton]] Bond films ''[[The Living Daylights (film)|The Living Daylights]]'' and ''[[Licence to Kill (film)|Licence to Kill]]''. \n\n''Quantum of Solace'' was successful at the box office, earning $586,090,727 worldwide. The film broke the record for the largest Friday opening in the UK, grossing 4.9 million pounds on the day of its release.",
    "Vehicles and Gadgets": "[[Ford]] has a three-film deal that began with 2002's ''[[Die Another Day (film)|Die Another Day]]''. The [[Aston Martin DBS V12]] returned in the film.",

During an earnings report, Bobby Kotick, the CEO of Activision, announced that their first Bond game would be released in May 2008. The game was changed to be a tie-in the the film ''Quantum of Solace'' and released in the UK on October 31, 2008 and the US the following week.",
    " Trivia ": "* The scene in which Fields is found lying across a bed drowned in crude oil is an homage to the 1964 Bond film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' in which [[Jill Masterson]] dies of 'epidermal suffocation' after being covered in gold paint. Oil is sometimes known as \"black gold\".\n* A slight oversight was noted by fans after Bond's passport and credit cards were cancelled. In the next scene, he has travelled from Austria to Italy with no apparent funds or form of transport. (However, the next Bond film, ''[[Skyfall (film)|Skyfall]]'', strongly implied that Bond is independently wealthy, and as the UK, Austria and Italy were all members of the European Union at the time, he would not have needed a passport to travel between the countries.)\n* Like ''Casino Royale,'' [[Q Branch]] does not appear and no gadgets are used by Bond or the villains in the film, other than common technology in 2008 such as period cell phones, computers, and satellites. The largest exception to this is M's electronic office wall at MI6. Sony Ericsson launched a limited edition Titanium silver C902 Cyber-shot™ phone as used by James Bond in the film.\n* Although credit is not given, the epilogue of the film, which sees Bond on a mission to warn a Canadian agent that her boyfriend is an enemy, parallels the plotline of the short story \"[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights|007 in New York]]\".\n*''Quantum of Solace'' is the only Bond film released since ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]'' to not have its title sequence designed by [[Daniel Kleinman]], and the third overall to not have titles designed by Kleinman or [[Maurice Binder]], the others being ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' and ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''.\n*This was the first ''Bond'' movie to released in a year ending with 8. There was no ''Bond'' movie in 1968, 1978, 1988 or 1998 beforehand.\n**The 2008 release also tied in with the centennial of ''Bond's'' creator Ian Fleming.\n* ''Quantum of Solace'' is the third Bond film to take its title from a story by Ian Fleming while adapting no elements therefrom, following [[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|''The Spy Who Loved Me'']] and [[A View to a Kill (film)|''A View to a Kill'']]. To date, it has also been the last of the Bond films from the Craig era to adapt the title of a Fleming story. \n*With a running time of only 106 minutes, ''Quantum of Solace'' is the shortest film in the entire franchise to date. Ironically, despite this, it was also confirmed to be the most violent; according to the a study in 2012 by the University of Otago in New Zealand, it had a count of 250 \"trivial or severely violent\" acts, which is the most depictions of violence in any ''Bond'' film.\n*At the time of its release, ''Quantum of Solace'' was unique for not featuring a romance between Bond and the leading \"Bond girl.\" Although they share a kiss briefly at the end, Camille and Bond do not otherwise have any romantic interludes, though Bond does romance another character in the film.\n*For the first time, the traditional gun barrel sequence ''ends'' a Bond film. It also ends ''Skyfall''.",
