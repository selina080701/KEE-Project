Sit. I'm Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin. So, by what means shall we execute you, Commander Bond?\"<br>\"What, no small-talk? No chit-chat? That's the trouble with the world these days, no one takes the time to do a really sinister interrogation anymore. It's a lost art.|[[Dimitri Mishkin]] and [[James Bond (Pierce Brosnan)|James Bond]]|GoldenEye}}\n'''''GoldenEye''''' is a 1995 spy film and the seventeenth [[James Bond|''James Bond'']] film, as well the first to star [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[United Kingdom|British]] secret service agent, [[James Bond (Pierce Brosnan)|James Bond]]. Made by [[Albert R. Broccoli]]'s [[EON Productions]] (though listed as \"Albert R. Broccoli presents\") it was the second official ''James Bond'' film not produced by Broccoli (although oversaw the film as Consulting Producer) himself. While undergoing heart surgery, Broccoli entrusted the making of the film and the forthcoming generation of ''James Bond'' films to his daughter [[Barbara Broccoli]] and stepson [[Michael G. Wilson]], both of whom had been executive producers of previous ''James Bond'' films. ''GoldenEye'' was released in [[1995]] and was directed by [[Martin Campbell]]. Campbell also directed [[2006]]'s ''Bond'' reboot film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\n''GoldenEye'' is considered an important film in the ''Bond'' series in that it was successful in reviving interest in a character that many critics had suggested had become an anachronism in the post-[[Cold War]] world, as well as modernizing the franchise. It is also known for having an [[Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean)|unusual Bond Villain]] that rivals James Bond in every way.\n\nThe previous film, ''[[Licence to Kill]]'', had been released in June 1989, before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Although ''GoldenEye'' was financially successful and critically acclaimed, it was not as popular as previous ''Bond'' films, suggesting interest in the series was waning at that point. In spite of this, it remains a fan-favorite, partially due to its [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 game)|critically acclaimed Nintendo 64 video game adaptation]]. It was followed by ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies (film)|Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' in 1997.\n\n[[Judi Dench]], the newly cast [[M (Judi Dench) (classic film continuity)|M]], describes Bond as a \"sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War.\" This unusual candor, combined with a generally well-received performance by Brosnan as the then-new [[James Bond (Pierce Brosnan)|James Bond]], helped to revitalize the franchise replacing [[Robert Brown]]. The role of [[Miss Moneypenny (Samantha Bond)|Miss Moneypenny]] was also recast with [[Samantha Bond]] replacing [[Caroline Bliss]] and [[Desmond Llewelyn]], returning as [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]].",
    "Plot summary": "===Arkhangelsk===\n[[File:AlecJamesJob.png|thumb|left|250px|Two [[00 Agents]], [[Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean)|Trevelyan]] (006) and [[James Bond (Pierce Brosnan)|Bond]] (007), infiltrate the chemical weapons plant.]]\nThe story starts in 1986, in the [[Soviet Union]]. British secret agent [[James Bond (Pierce Brosnan)|James Bond]], known as 007, and his fellow 00 Agent and friend, [[Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean)|Alec Trevelyan]] (006), have infiltrated a [[Arkangel Chemical Weapons Facility|secret Soviet chemical weapons production]] plant with the intention of blowing it up via bombs. \n\nAfter finding their target, a large room filled with chemical canisters, James begins to plant the charges while Alec holds off the facility's guards. 006 is then suddenly captured by a ruthless Soviet colonel, [[General Ourumov (Gottfried John)|Arkady Ourumov]], who then orders 007 to surrender by pointing a gun to Alec's head. Alec tells Bond to \"finish the job\", and in response Bond resets the charge timers from six minutes to three and walks out to surrender. Ourumov counts ten seconds for Bond to comply, and Bond does so, only then Ourumov executes Alec with a shot to the head when he defiantly shouts \"FOR ENGLAND, JAMES!!\". \n\nWith his fellow 00 Agent down, Bond retreats to his hiding spot just as Ourumov's men fire. Ourumov stops and warns them that any further gunfire will kill them all since the place is filled with large gas tanks. Thinking fast, Bond quickly takes cover behind a cart of chemical canisters and moves it toward a cargo conveyor belt that leads outside. In the tense moment, a nervous guard shoot at Bond and is immediately executed by Ourumov.  \n\nActivating the conveyor belt, Bond is able to escape on it and shoots open the dispensers holding hundreds of other canisters which fall on Ourumov's men. Outside the facility, a plane is taking off and Bond attempts to hitch a ride to safety. Ourumov sends troops out, together with motorcycling scouts. Bond manages to chase after the plane, but in a wrestle for control of the plane pulls himself and the pilot out. Knocking the pilot into the path of a motorcycle scout resulting them both killed in the collision, Bond uses the motorcycle to chase after the pilot-less plane, heading to the cliff edge. \n\nOurumov halts his men realizing Bond seems to be after an apparent suicide. With the plane and him falling off the edge, Bond dives for the cockpit. He successfully regains control of the plane and flies off as the chemical facility explodes.\n\n===Monaco===\nThe story continues in 1995, nine years after the Arkangel incident. Bond is driving in the mountains near [[Monaco]] with a [[Caroline|female psychiatrist]] from [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] in his signature [[Aston Martin DB5]] (the car making a long-awaited return since ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''). She is assigned to evaluate his mental state, but nervously notices he is driving very fast. Bond drives down a mountain road and becomes involved in a dangerous race with a beautiful woman in a [[Ferrari F355 GTS]]. The two drivers silently agree to a race, resulting in a near collision with an oncoming tractor and a bike entourage all falling down. After a while, the psychiatrist, citing Bond's reckless nature, demands that he halt the 'game'. Bond does so by pulling the handbrake, then comforts her. He reveals there is some expensive wine in the car's storage, then kisses the psychiatrist, seducing her.\n\n[[File:Xenia_Monte_Carlo.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen)|Xenia Onatopp]] in casino of Montecarlo]]\nBond heads over to a casino, where he notices the woman in the Ferrari is there as well from the presence of her parked car. He notes it is a stolen model then heads over to where she is, playing and winning a game of Chemin de Fer against the woman. Finally losing after a winning streak, she gets enraged and storms off. Bond follows her and introduces himself, she likewise does the same revealing herself as [[Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen)|Xenia Onatopp]]. Bond identifies her accent as Georgian then tries to warn her of driving a stolen car, but she tells him she knows a man in motoring business. She then proceeds to retire for the night with a [[Chuck Farrel|Canadian Naval Admiral]]. \n\nAfter she leaves, Bond remotely observes her from afar, noting she and the admiral are staying at a yacht where he photographs her and the yacht's launch-boat model. Bond learns, with the help of [[Miss Moneypenny (Samantha Bond)|Miss Moneypenny]] on his car's radio transmitter that she belongs to crime syndicate \"[[Janus Syndicate|Janus]]\" which operates out of St. Petersburg and [[M (Judi Dench) (classic film continuity)|M]] authorizes him to follow her without any physical contact. That night, Onatopp murders the admiral during sex via suffocating him by crushing his chest between her thighs. Just as she does so, a mysterious hand steals the admiral's identity card. \n\nThe next morning, Bond proceeds to investigate the admiral's yacht, finding him dead in the closet. He then boards a motorboat and speeds to a [[La Fayette (F710)|''La Fayette'' frigate]], which is holding a military demonstration of the new  [[Eurocopter Tiger|the Tiger attack helicopter]]. As explained by the NATO speaker at the frigate, the helicopter employs cutting-edge technology, including radar stealth and being proofed against all forms of electromagnetic warfare. Meanwhile, Onatopp executes the two pilots, with her and her collaborator taking their places to get aboard the Tiger helicopter and steal it. Arriving too late, Bond is restrained when he tries to stop the theft and watches helplessly as Xenia and her accomplice fly away.\n\n===Severnaya===\nIn [[Siberia]], at [[Severnaya]], at a [[Severnaya Satellite Control Center|Russian satellite control center]], [[Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco)|Natalya Simonova]] does her usual rounds of programming just as her co-worker, [[Boris Grishenko]] reveals his hacking plans and succeeds in hacking the [[FBI]], proclaiming he is a genius. Natalya heads for some coffee as Boris heads outside for a cigarette. \n\n[[File:Xenia murderer.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Massacre of the Severnaya workers.]]\nHowever, his smoking break is disrupted by the landing of the Eurocopter, housing Ourumov - now a General, and Onatopp. Walking into the facility for a surprise inspection, the facility houses the new and powerful satellite weapons system called [[GoldenEye (weapon)|GoldenEye]]. General Ourumov tells the facility commander he wants an unscheduled test of the weapon, ordering rapid retrieval of the activation disk and keys. After acquiring them however, Onatopp opens fire on all personnel at the facility and as she kills, she shows signs of an arousal, to the slight bewilderment of her boss.  \n\nOnatopp and Ourumov then activate the GoldenEye satellite, which contains a nuclear warhead capable of delivering an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) in Earth's upper atmosphere. They test the weapon, targeting Severnaya. Unknown however to Onatopp and Ourumov, Natalya wasn't in the room when the others were murdered. Natalya inadvertently blows her cover, signalling Onatopp to check. Just then, a barely alive technician activates an SOS alarm which Onatopp shoots in response. Calculating that the military will be too late to respond, Ourumov still suggests they leave at once. Onatopp heads for the pantry where Natalya was then finds a broken coffee cup and spots the air vent loose. She fires at it thinking she likely killed the person hiding there.\n\nOurumov and Onatopp escape in the Eurocopter, just as Natalya crawls out of the cupboard under the counter where she hid from Onatopp in the pantry. Three Russian fighters are dispatched to the scene, called by the SOS. \n\nNatalya surveys the dead, before realizing the GoldenEye sets off its EMP blast (noting the main screen's countdown). The facility has all its electronics exploding just as Natalya daftly runs for cover. The fighters are also affected by the blast, two self-destruct as their electronics fail. The last one crashes directly into the facility's foundations, causing the radar dish above to collapse. Natalya is nearly killed from all the explosions but survives. \n\nShe tries to escape from the facility but all the electronics are dead, trapping her. The weight of the radar dish, however, plunges it down from above, giving Natalya a way out of the facility. She climbs out of the underground facility with the help of the girders and finds huskies, relieved.\n\nAt MI6 headquarters, in an observation room, Bond talks with [[Bill Tanner (Michael Kitchen)|Bill Tanner]], the SIS CHIEF of Staff, who tells him they found the missing Eurocopter at Severnaya by satellite imagery. M enters, just as Tanner finishes briefing Bond. All three witness the total disruption of images and electronics in the region resulting from the GoldenEye EMP blast, but are shocked by the sudden blackout of imagery. As their systems are rebooted and Bill informing them it indeed was an EMP blast. On a screen, 007 spots a survivor crawling away. Bond tells M that the survivor could know more, revealed to be Natalya. \n\n[[File:432A JAMES BOND ARCHIVES XL 00399 Gallery.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Bond and M holding the mission briefing together.]]\nIn M's office, Bond is further briefed about the GoldenEye, which leads to data on Ourumov who has been promoted to General and views himself as the next Iron Man of Russia. Following a brief and tense conversation where M senses Bond doesn't trust her judgement, she tells him he is a \"sexist, misogynist dinosaur\" and a \"relic of the Cold War\". She however orders him to go St. Petersburg to investigate the connections between the GoldenEye weapons system (possibly finding Natalya), Ourumov and the mysterious Russian crime syndicate Janus. She also warns him to complete his mission and not to focus on revenge on Ourumov for 006's murder. Before Bond leaves M's office, M tells Bond to come back alive.\n\nBond drops by [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]]'s lab and is given a [[Laser Wristwatch]], a belt loaded with a cable that can support his weight and a [[Explosive Pen|ballpoint pen]] which doubles as a grenade when clicked three times. Bond is also shown his new car, a [[BMW Z3]] which Q reminds Bond he is \"not to break the traffic laws\" with it despite it being fully loaded with the essentials.\n\n===Arrival St. Petersburg===\n[[File:7YkzUi6h.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Bond and [[Jack Wade]] meet.]]\nOurumov meets with Russia's defense council, headed by [[Dmitri Mishkin (Tchéky Karyo)|Defense Minister Mishkin]], in a hearing about Severnaya's destruction. Ourumov reports that he investigated the matter and deduces the attack was committed by Siberian separatists and he then gives his resignation. Mishkin however, tells him of his findings of two survivors from the attack at Severnaya. Ourumov states he knows about only one survivor, Boris. However, Ourumov didn't realize that Natalya had survived the blast and Mishkin updates him on it. Ourumov states he will look into the matter himself. \n\nNatalya manages to make it to St. Petersburg, knowing she is being wanted by the authorities. She makes her way to a computer seller, borrowing one computer to contact Boris online. Boris tells her she's not safe and informs her to meet him at a chapel. There, she is instead promptly captured by Boris and Onatopp.\n\nBond arrives at St. Petersburg airport and proceeds to meet his [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] contact, [[Jack Wade]]. Wade tells him that nobody knows about Janus except a former [[KGB]] agent [[Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane)|Zukovsky]] who is one of Janus' business rivals. Wade agrees to take Bond to the hideout of Zukovsky, whom Bond previously wounded and stole his girlfriend.\n\nAfter a tense introduction, Bond is taken by Zukovsky's men where Zukovsky forces an interrogation. He is still quite bitter about his wounded leg though and shots the sofa Bond is sitting on, almost hitting the 00 Agent. He nearly ends Bond but ultimately agrees to give aid when offered a bribe and explosives. Sharing a drink in his office, Zukovsky also informs Bond some history about Janus' leader; a child of Lienz Cossack parents whose tribe had worked with the Nazis during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and were given refuge by the British government. However, they were betrayed by the British and remanded back to USSR where they were all executed under orders from [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]. Bond wants Zukovsky to set him up with a meeting of Janus, to which Zukovsky agrees, now satisfied him and Bond are even.\n\n===Spa and the Statue Graveyard===\n[[File:Goldeneye_-_Trevelyan_reveals_himself.jpg|thumb|309x309px|left|Trevelyan reveals himself to Bond.]]\nAt his hotel's pool and steam room, Bond meets Xenia again, who tries to kill Bond with her legs. Bond refuses to be seduced or injured and after a struggle, points [[Walther PPK|his handgun]] on her and orders her to take him to Janus. Onatopp drives Bond to a [[St. Petersburg Soviet Statue Graveyard|statue graveyard of old Russian political figures]], telling he will find Janus there. Bond knocks Xenia unconscious and walks out to find Janus. \n\nAs Bond searches the graveyard, a figure appears and greets him. The figure reveals himself as Bond's old friend Alec Trevelyan - 006, alive and well, with the right side of his face scarred, because of Bond changing the detonation sequence on the charge timers. He took the name \"Janus\" as a reference to the two-faced Roman god. Trevelyan explains how his parents escaped Stalin's execution of their people and fled to England but later killed themselves because of the shame of surviving. Closing their conversation and Alec now utterly betraying Bond and MI6 altogether, Bond attempts to shoot Alec but gets suddenly shot in the neck with a tranquilizer dart. \n\nAwakened by Natalya screaming in the backseat, Bond finds himself the pilot's seat of the Eurocopter which has been programmed to fire its rockets at itself. Unable to stop the firing sequence, Bond manages to strike the cockpit ejection button at the last second with his head and the two are ejected in a capsule. Although they survived the trap, they are however, immediately arrested by the Russian army and are taken to the [[St. Petersburg Military Archives]].\n\n===Military Archives, Tank Chase & Train===\n[[File:Archives.jpg|thumb|Bond protecting Natalya at the St. Petersburg archives.]]\nAt the Military Archives, Bond and Natalya are placed inside a holding cell, to wait for interrogator's arrival. While in a cell, Bond tells Natalya that he is aware of her role in Severnaya, pointing out that her watch is stopped by the EMP blast. Initially denying, she proceeds to tell him she knows little else besides Ourumov's theft of the GoldenEye control disk and that Boris is working with the General. [[Dmitri Mishkin (Tchéky Karyo)|Minister Mishkin]] then enters and threatens Bond with execution for terrorism. Bond retorts him, saying it is an act of treason from within. Natalya quiets them both and tells Mishkin that Ourumov stole GoldenEye.\n\nOurumov suddenly bursts into the room and protests that Mishkin is interfering with Ourumov's investigation. Mishkin shuts down Ourumov but Ourumov seizes Bond's Walther PPK and kills both a guard and Mishkin, hoping to frame Bond for the murders while trying to escape. Bond is able to knock Ourumov unconscious, shoot down many enemy guards before he and Natalya escape into the archives. After she is captured by Ourumov, Bond manages to escape outside and spots many vintage tanks. \n\n[[File:BondWiki GE Tank Photo11.png|thumb|left|270px|Bond commandeering a T-55 tank to chase down fleeing Ourumov.]]\nAs Bond hides among the equipment, he sees Ourumov forcing Natalya into his [[GAZ-31029|GAZ Volga]]. The car speeds away just as military vehicles arrive. Bond commandeers a nearby [[T-55 tank]] and bursts through a wall in pursuit. The chase tears through city streets as Ourumov orders his driver to evade Bond’s tank. The Volga weaves through traffic, passing landmarks and scattering soldiers while Bond’s tank crushes obstacles in its path.\n\nAs the pursuit continues, the chaos draws the attention of police and civilians. Bond uses the tank’s cannon to clear a path, while Ourumov’s desperation grows. Natalya pleads with him to stop, but he refuses, focused only on escaping. The chase barrels through narrow alleys and public squares until Bond finally tracks them to a train yard where Ourumov and Natalya board a large, black [[Soviet Missile Train|Russian missile train]] that serves as Alec's base of operations. \n\nAlec taunts and tries to seduce Natalya but she resists, before he is called away by an alert. It turns out that Bond drove the tank out of a tunnel in front of the train's path, hoping to derail it, with Alec ordering the train to continue at full speed. Just as it nears the T-55, Bond opens fire with the tank's turret but the train still rushes towards the tank despite the brakes being activated, crashing into it. \n\n[[File:JBondTrainStandOff.jpeg|thumb|right|270px|Stand-off on the train]]\nWith the train crashing into a halt and knocking everyone down, Bond manages to hold Alec and Onatopp at gunpoint. Alec radios Ourumov to bring Natalya, knowing Bond cannot ignore the presence of a helpless lady. Bond tells Ourumov of Alec's Cossack heritage, warning of potential betrayal which Alec denies. Bond ultimately chose to save Natalya with an abandoned Ouromov shot as Alec escapes with Xenia. Alec locks the train, trapping Bond and Natalya inside and tells Bond that he has planted explosives on the train with timers set for the same six minutes Bond gave him years before before escaping in a helicopter, saying \"''Good luck with the floor, James''\". \n\nKnowing they only have three minutes to survive, Bond quickly cuts through the floor with his watch's laser while Natalya finds Boris backing up his computer data. With aid from Bond on Boris' riddle password, Natalya manages to track Boris' location somewhere near Havana, [[Cuba]]. Realizing he has been hacked, Boris frantically removes the physical hard drives from the system, cutting off the transmission. Bond and Natalya manage to escape the train just before it explodes. After sitting on the tracks and planning their next move, Bond and Natalya kiss.\n\n===Cuba===\nBond and Natalya travel to Cuba and meet Jack Wade who provides his SIS colleague with gadgets from Q. Wade also informs his friend the Americans could not find any satellite dish though Natalya is certain there is one. Bond exchanges his car for Wade's plane and later, Natalya is angered by the fact of Bond's cold nature. Bond informs her that he must kill his former 00 Agent friend in order to stop him. They reconcile and spend a romantic night together.\n\n[[File:Xenia_-_a_good_squeeze.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Xenia ironically dies by enjoying a good \"squeeze\".]]\nThe next morning the pair fly over the island and find a lake. As they think it is nothing of interest, a surface-to-air missile is fired out of the lake damaging their plane. At the crash site, Bond is awakened to a helicopter flying overhead and Onatopp rappels down from and attacks Bond. She starts to squeeze Bond with her legs, intending to kill him for good, but Bond is able to reconnect her harness cord, snatch her shouldered rifle and shoot the chopper down. That caused the chopper to lose control and violently yank Xenia against two tree branches, killing the evil [[Bond girl|Bond Girl]] as the chopper crashes and explodes. \n\nBond and Natalya soon discover that the lake actually hides the [[Janus Satellite Control Center|giant satellite dish]]. In an underground control center, Alec and Boris activate the second satellite, and the target assigned is London. Alec's plan is to destroy every computer system of the country causing nation-wide chaos. The blast will also erase all electronic records, but not before Alec has Boris break into the Bank of London and steal all of its cash reserves.\n\nBond and Natalya split up; Bond setting remote charges while Natalya goes to deal with the satellite remotely. Natalya finds a computer terminal, hoping to reprogram the GoldenEye satellite with new codes. Buying time for Natalya, Bond deliberately gets captured after causing a leak in a fuel tank which the charges are attached to and armed. Bond is brought to a taunting Alec who takes his watch and easily disarms the charges planted. \n\nNatalya is soon also captured and brought to Alec, where she assaults a grateful Boris. He mistakenly picks up Bond's grenade pen in the scuffle, nervously clicking it as he shortly receives a signal that the satellite is changing course, now headed down to crash into earth. Discovering Natalya's doing, Boris attempts to break her codes while nervously clicking the grenade pen. Bond focuses on the number of times Boris clicks and just as Boris screams at Natalya in frustration, Bond knocks the activated pen to a pool of leaked fuel from before. Despite the charges being disarmed the pen's grenade triggers a combined explosion, disabling much of the facility. Using the moment of chaos, Bond and Natalya sneak away to a nearby lift.\n\nAlthough Natalya has changed the codes, she determines Boris may still break them, so they have to destroy the antenna to be certain. Bond hands Natalya a gun from a guard then tells Natalya to remain covert as he heads for the satellite antenna. Alec orders Boris to continue working on the codes to the satellite, calling a guard to keep him in line at gunpoint. The former 006 chases after 007 and a furious fight occurs on the antenna's beam steering mechanism. During the shoot-out, Boris manages to crack Natalia's code and tries to realign the antenna. Bond notices the satellite's reactivation and physically jams the gears of the beam steering mechanism, rendering it disabled. This confuses Boris who cannot complete the antenna's reprogramming, setting it still on course to crash into the earth.\n\n[[File:Bond vs Trevelyan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|006 vs. 007]]\nThe showdown between James Bond and Alec Trevelyan eventually leads to the carriage house of the antenna's line feed. While the two 00 Agents seem evenly matched, taking blow for blow, Trevelyan temporarily gains the upper hand, holding Bond at gunpoint, gloating that he is the better fighter, saying \"''You know, James, I was always better''\",  when Bond kicks open and slips down the maintenance hatch ladder. Trevelyan realizes he has gone too far to quit and calls in a helicopter to pick him up. \n\nTrevelyan chases Bond down to the line feed, and has Bond in a stranglehold when the helicopter appears. However, as 006 could potentially kill 007 at this moment, Alec ends up distracted when Natalya, who snuck aboard the helicopter, holds the pilot at gunpoint. Finding the chance he desperately needed, Bond headbutts Trevelyan and kicks him off the platform to overpower him. Regardless, Bond catches his old partner's leg, telling him in a dark manner, that he is not killing Trevelyan \"for England\" but for himself.\n\nFinally defeating his rival, Bond drops Trevelyan, and as the latter hits the bottom of the dish but somehow survives the fall, the second GoldenEye destructs in the atmosphere. Bond jumps and manages to hold onto the landing skid of the helicopter as it flies away. The disabled antenna's beam steering mechanism soon explodes, causing it to fall and collapse line feed first upon a screaming Trevelyan, ultimately crushing the corrupt 00 Agent to death. Then, the debris of the antenna perforates the base and decimates the main control center. Although it seems Boris survived the destruction and upon declaring himself invincible, the coolant tanks subsequently rupture. The liquid nitrogen within engulfs Boris, freezing him to death.\n\n[[File:Bond and Natalya going to Guantanamo.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Bond and Natalya picked up by the Marines after Trevelyan's plan is foiled.]]\nThe helicopter pilot drops Bond and Natalya on a grassy field and leaves. The pair romantically make out for a moment before being rudely interrupted by Wade. He reveals a company of US Marines camouflaged in the vicinity has noticed them and offer to take them to safety. Here, Bond ultimately succeeds his mission.",

He then boards a motorboat and speeds to a [[La Fayette (F710)|''La Fayette'' frigate]], which is holding a military demonstration of the new  [[Eurocopter Tiger|the Tiger attack helicopter]]. As explained by the NATO speaker at the frigate, the helicopter employs cutting-edge technology, including radar stealth and being proofed against all forms of electromagnetic warfare. Meanwhile, Onatopp executes the two pilots, with her and her collaborator taking their places to get aboard the Tiger helicopter and steal it. Arriving too late, Bond is restrained when he tries to stop the theft and watches helplessly as Xenia and her accomplice fly away.",
    "Severnaya": "In [[Siberia]], at [[Severnaya]], at a [[Severnaya Satellite Control Center|Russian satellite control center]], [[Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco)|Natalya Simonova]] does her usual rounds of programming just as her co-worker, [[Boris Grishenko]] reveals his hacking plans and succeeds in hacking the [[FBI]], proclaiming he is a genius. Natalya heads for some coffee as Boris heads outside for a cigarette. \n\n[[File:Xenia murderer.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Massacre of the Severnaya workers.]]\nHowever, his smoking break is disrupted by the landing of the Eurocopter, housing Ourumov - now a General, and Onatopp. Walking into the facility for a surprise inspection, the facility houses the new and powerful satellite weapons system called [[GoldenEye (weapon)|GoldenEye]]. General Ourumov tells the facility commander he wants an unscheduled test of the weapon, ordering rapid retrieval of the activation disk and keys. After acquiring them however, Onatopp opens fire on all personnel at the facility and as she kills, she shows signs of an arousal, to the slight bewilderment of her boss.  \n\nOnatopp and Ourumov then activate the GoldenEye satellite, which contains a nuclear warhead capable of delivering an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) in Earth's upper atmosphere. They test the weapon, targeting Severnaya. Unknown however to Onatopp and Ourumov, Natalya wasn't in the room when the others were murdered. Natalya inadvertently blows her cover, signalling Onatopp to check. Just then, a barely alive technician activates an SOS alarm which Onatopp shoots in response. Calculating that the military will be too late to respond, Ourumov still suggests they leave at once. Onatopp heads for the pantry where Natalya was then finds a broken coffee cup and spots the air vent loose. She fires at it thinking she likely killed the person hiding there.\n\nOurumov and Onatopp escape in the Eurocopter, just as Natalya crawls out of the cupboard under the counter where she hid from Onatopp in the pantry. Three Russian fighters are dispatched to the scene, called by the SOS. \n\nNatalya surveys the dead, before realizing the GoldenEye sets off its EMP blast (noting the main screen's countdown). The facility has all its electronics exploding just as Natalya daftly runs for cover. The fighters are also affected by the blast, two self-destruct as their electronics fail. The last one crashes directly into the facility's foundations, causing the radar dish above to collapse. Natalya is nearly killed from all the explosions but survives. \n\nShe tries to escape from the facility but all the electronics are dead, trapping her. The weight of the radar dish, however, plunges it down from above, giving Natalya a way out of the facility. She climbs out of the underground facility with the help of the girders and finds huskies, relieved.\n\nAt MI6 headquarters, in an observation room, Bond talks with [[Bill Tanner (Michael Kitchen)|Bill Tanner]], the SIS CHIEF of Staff, who tells him they found the missing Eurocopter at Severnaya by satellite imagery. M enters, just as Tanner finishes briefing Bond. All three witness the total disruption of images and electronics in the region resulting from the GoldenEye EMP blast, but are shocked by the sudden blackout of imagery. As their systems are rebooted and Bill informing them it indeed was an EMP blast. On a screen, 007 spots a survivor crawling away. Bond tells M that the survivor could know more, revealed to be Natalya. \n\n[[File:432A JAMES BOND ARCHIVES XL 00399 Gallery.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Bond and M holding the mission briefing together.]]\nIn M's office, Bond is further briefed about the GoldenEye, which leads to data on Ourumov who has been promoted to General and views himself as the next Iron Man of Russia. Following a brief and tense conversation where M senses Bond doesn't trust her judgement, she tells him he is a \"sexist, misogynist dinosaur\" and a \"relic of the Cold War\". She however orders him to go St. Petersburg to investigate the connections between the GoldenEye weapons system (possibly finding Natalya), Ourumov and the mysterious Russian crime syndicate Janus. She also warns him to complete his mission and not to focus on revenge on Ourumov for 006's murder. Before Bond leaves M's office, M tells Bond to come back alive.\n\nBond drops by [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]]'s lab and is given a [[Laser Wristwatch]], a belt loaded with a cable that can support his weight and a [[Explosive Pen|ballpoint pen]] which doubles as a grenade when clicked three times. Bond is also shown his new car, a [[BMW Z3]] which Q reminds Bond he is \"not to break the traffic laws\" with it despite it being fully loaded with the essentials.",
    "Arrival St. Petersburg": "[[File:7YkzUi6h.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Bond and [[Jack Wade]] meet.]]\nOurumov meets with Russia's defense council, headed by [[Dmitri Mishkin (Tchéky Karyo)|Defense Minister Mishkin]], in a hearing about Severnaya's destruction. Ourumov reports that he investigated the matter and deduces the attack was committed by Siberian separatists and he then gives his resignation. Mishkin however, tells him of his findings of two survivors from the attack at Severnaya. Ourumov states he knows about only one survivor, Boris. However, Ourumov didn't realize that Natalya had survived the blast and Mishkin updates him on it. Ourumov states he will look into the matter himself. \n\nNatalya manages to make it to St. Petersburg, knowing she is being wanted by the authorities. She makes her way to a computer seller, borrowing one computer to contact Boris online. Boris tells her she's not safe and informs her to meet him at a chapel. There, she is instead promptly captured by Boris and Onatopp.\n\nBond arrives at St. Petersburg airport and proceeds to meet his [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] contact, [[Jack Wade]]. Wade tells him that nobody knows about Janus except a former [[KGB]] agent [[Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane)|Zukovsky]] who is one of Janus' business rivals. Wade agrees to take Bond to the hideout of Zukovsky, whom Bond previously wounded and stole his girlfriend.\n\nAfter a tense introduction, Bond is taken by Zukovsky's men where Zukovsky forces an interrogation. He is still quite bitter about his wounded leg though and shots the sofa Bond is sitting on, almost hitting the 00 Agent. He nearly ends Bond but ultimately agrees to give aid when offered a bribe and explosives. Sharing a drink in his office, Zukovsky also informs Bond some history about Janus' leader; a child of Lienz Cossack parents whose tribe had worked with the Nazis during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and were given refuge by the British government. However, they were betrayed by the British and remanded back to USSR where they were all executed under orders from [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]. Bond wants Zukovsky to set him up with a meeting of Janus, to which Zukovsky agrees, now satisfied him and Bond are even.",
    "Spa and the Statue Graveyard": "[[File:Goldeneye_-_Trevelyan_reveals_himself.jpg|thumb|309x309px|left|Trevelyan reveals himself to Bond.]]\nAt his hotel's pool and steam room, Bond meets Xenia again, who tries to kill Bond with her legs. Bond refuses to be seduced or injured and after a struggle, points [[Walther PPK|his handgun]] on her and orders her to take him to Janus. Onatopp drives Bond to a [[St. Petersburg Soviet Statue Graveyard|statue graveyard of old Russian political figures]], telling he will find Janus there. Bond knocks Xenia unconscious and walks out to find Janus. \n\nAs Bond searches the graveyard, a figure appears and greets him. The figure reveals himself as Bond's old friend Alec Trevelyan - 006, alive and well, with the right side of his face scarred, because of Bond changing the detonation sequence on the charge timers. He took the name \"Janus\" as a reference to the two-faced Roman god. Trevelyan explains how his parents escaped Stalin's execution of their people and fled to England but later killed themselves because of the shame of surviving. Closing their conversation and Alec now utterly betraying Bond and MI6 altogether, Bond attempts to shoot Alec but gets suddenly shot in the neck with a tranquilizer dart. \n\nAwakened by Natalya screaming in the backseat, Bond finds himself the pilot's seat of the Eurocopter which has been programmed to fire its rockets at itself. Unable to stop the firing sequence, Bond manages to strike the cockpit ejection button at the last second with his head and the two are ejected in a capsule. Although they survived the trap, they are however, immediately arrested by the Russian army and are taken to the [[St. Petersburg Military Archives]].",
    "Military Archives, Tank Chase & Train": "[[File:Archives.jpg|thumb|Bond protecting Natalya at the St. Petersburg archives.]]\nAt the Military Archives, Bond and Natalya are placed inside a holding cell, to wait for interrogator's arrival. While in a cell, Bond tells Natalya that he is aware of her role in Severnaya, pointing out that her watch is stopped by the EMP blast. Initially denying, she proceeds to tell him she knows little else besides Ourumov's theft of the GoldenEye control disk and that Boris is working with the General. [[Dmitri Mishkin (Tchéky Karyo)|Minister Mishkin]] then enters and threatens Bond with execution for terrorism. Bond retorts him, saying it is an act of treason from within. Natalya quiets them both and tells Mishkin that Ourumov stole GoldenEye.\n\nOurumov suddenly bursts into the room and protests that Mishkin is interfering with Ourumov's investigation. Mishkin shuts down Ourumov but Ourumov seizes Bond's Walther PPK and kills both a guard and Mishkin, hoping to frame Bond for the murders while trying to escape. Bond is able to knock Ourumov unconscious, shoot down many enemy guards before he and Natalya escape into the archives. After she is captured by Ourumov, Bond manages to escape outside and spots many vintage tanks. \n\n[[File:BondWiki GE Tank Photo11.png|thumb|left|270px|Bond commandeering a T-55 tank to chase down fleeing Ourumov.]]\nAs Bond hides among the equipment, he sees Ourumov forcing Natalya into his [[GAZ-31029|GAZ Volga]]. The car speeds away just as military vehicles arrive. Bond commandeers a nearby [[T-55 tank]] and bursts through a wall in pursuit. The chase tears through city streets as Ourumov orders his driver to evade Bond’s tank. The Volga weaves through traffic, passing landmarks and scattering soldiers while Bond’s tank crushes obstacles in its path.\n\nAs the pursuit continues, the chaos draws the attention of police and civilians. Bond uses the tank’s cannon to clear a path, while Ourumov’s desperation grows. Natalya pleads with him to stop, but he refuses, focused only on escaping. The chase barrels through narrow alleys and public squares until Bond finally tracks them to a train yard where Ourumov and Natalya board a large, black [[Soviet Missile Train|Russian missile train]] that serves as Alec's base of operations. \n\nAlec taunts and tries to seduce Natalya but she resists, before he is called away by an alert. It turns out that Bond drove the tank out of a tunnel in front of the train's path, hoping to derail it, with Alec ordering the train to continue at full speed. Just as it nears the T-55, Bond opens fire with the tank's turret but the train still rushes towards the tank despite the brakes being activated, crashing into it. \n\n[[File:JBondTrainStandOff.jpeg|thumb|right|270px|Stand-off on the train]]\nWith the train crashing into a halt and knocking everyone down, Bond manages to hold Alec and Onatopp at gunpoint. Alec radios Ourumov to bring Natalya, knowing Bond cannot ignore the presence of a helpless lady. Bond tells Ourumov of Alec's Cossack heritage, warning of potential betrayal which Alec denies. Bond ultimately chose to save Natalya with an abandoned Ouromov shot as Alec escapes with Xenia. Alec locks the train, trapping Bond and Natalya inside and tells Bond that he has planted explosives on the train with timers set for the same six minutes Bond gave him years before before escaping in a helicopter, saying \"''Good luck with the floor, James''\". \n\nKnowing they only have three minutes to survive, Bond quickly cuts through the floor with his watch's laser while Natalya finds Boris backing up his computer data. With aid from Bond on Boris' riddle password, Natalya manages to track Boris' location somewhere near Havana, [[Cuba]]. Realizing he has been hacked, Boris frantically removes the physical hard drives from the system, cutting off the transmission. Bond and Natalya manage to escape the train just before it explodes. After sitting on the tracks and planning their next move, Bond and Natalya kiss.",
    "Cuba": "Bond and Natalya travel to Cuba and meet Jack Wade who provides his SIS colleague with gadgets from Q. Wade also informs his friend the Americans could not find any satellite dish though Natalya is certain there is one. Bond exchanges his car for Wade's plane and later, Natalya is angered by the fact of Bond's cold nature. Bond informs her that he must kill his former 00 Agent friend in order to stop him. They reconcile and spend a romantic night together.\n\n[[File:Xenia_-_a_good_squeeze.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Xenia ironically dies by enjoying a good \"squeeze\".]]\nThe next morning the pair fly over the island and find a lake. As they think it is nothing of interest, a surface-to-air missile is fired out of the lake damaging their plane. At the crash site, Bond is awakened to a helicopter flying overhead and Onatopp rappels down from and attacks Bond. She starts to squeeze Bond with her legs, intending to kill him for good, but Bond is able to reconnect her harness cord, snatch her shouldered rifle and shoot the chopper down. That caused the chopper to lose control and violently yank Xenia against two tree branches, killing the evil [[Bond girl|Bond Girl]] as the chopper crashes and explodes. \n\nBond and Natalya soon discover that the lake actually hides the [[Janus Satellite Control Center|giant satellite dish]]. In an underground control center, Alec and Boris activate the second satellite, and the target assigned is London. Alec's plan is to destroy every computer system of the country causing nation-wide chaos. The blast will also erase all electronic records, but not before Alec has Boris break into the Bank of London and steal all of its cash reserves.\n\nBond and Natalya split up; Bond setting remote charges while Natalya goes to deal with the satellite remotely. Natalya finds a computer terminal, hoping to reprogram the GoldenEye satellite with new codes. Buying time for Natalya, Bond deliberately gets captured after causing a leak in a fuel tank which the charges are attached to and armed. Bond is brought to a taunting Alec who takes his watch and easily disarms the charges planted. \n\nNatalya is soon also captured and brought to Alec, where she assaults a grateful Boris. He mistakenly picks up Bond's grenade pen in the scuffle, nervously clicking it as he shortly receives a signal that the satellite is changing course, now headed down to crash into earth. Discovering Natalya's doing, Boris attempts to break her codes while nervously clicking the grenade pen. Bond focuses on the number of times Boris clicks and just as Boris screams at Natalya in frustration, Bond knocks the activated pen to a pool of leaked fuel from before. Despite the charges being disarmed the pen's grenade triggers a combined explosion, disabling much of the facility. Using the moment of chaos, Bond and Natalya sneak away to a nearby lift.\n\nAlthough Natalya has changed the codes, she determines Boris may still break them, so they have to destroy the antenna to be certain. Bond hands Natalya a gun from a guard then tells Natalya to remain covert as he heads for the satellite antenna. Alec orders Boris to continue working on the codes to the satellite, calling a guard to keep him in line at gunpoint. The former 006 chases after 007 and a furious fight occurs on the antenna's beam steering mechanism. During the shoot-out, Boris manages to crack Natalia's code and tries to realign the antenna. Bond notices the satellite's reactivation and physically jams the gears of the beam steering mechanism, rendering it disabled. This confuses Boris who cannot complete the antenna's reprogramming, setting it still on course to crash into the earth.\n\n[[File:Bond vs Trevelyan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|006 vs. 007]]\nThe showdown between James Bond and Alec Trevelyan eventually leads to the carriage house of the antenna's line feed. While the two 00 Agents seem evenly matched, taking blow for blow, Trevelyan temporarily gains the upper hand, holding Bond at gunpoint, gloating that he is the better fighter, saying \"''You know, James, I was always better''\",  when Bond kicks open and slips down the maintenance hatch ladder. Trevelyan realizes he has gone too far to quit and calls in a helicopter to pick him up. \n\nTrevelyan chases Bond down to the line feed, and has Bond in a stranglehold when the helicopter appears. However, as 006 could potentially kill 007 at this moment, Alec ends up distracted when Natalya, who snuck aboard the helicopter, holds the pilot at gunpoint. Finding the chance he desperately needed, Bond headbutts Trevelyan and kicks him off the platform to overpower him. Regardless, Bond catches his old partner's leg, telling him in a dark manner, that he is not killing Trevelyan \"for England\" but for himself.\n\nFinally defeating his rival, Bond drops Trevelyan, and as the latter hits the bottom of the dish but somehow survives the fall, the second GoldenEye destructs in the atmosphere. Bond jumps and manages to hold onto the landing skid of the helicopter as it flies away. The disabled antenna's beam steering mechanism soon explodes, causing it to fall and collapse line feed first upon a screaming Trevelyan, ultimately crushing the corrupt 00 Agent to death. Then, the debris of the antenna perforates the base and decimates the main control center. Although it seems Boris survived the destruction and upon declaring himself invincible, the coolant tanks subsequently rupture. The liquid nitrogen within engulfs Boris, freezing him to death.\n\n[[File:Bond and Natalya going to Guantanamo.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Bond and Natalya picked up by the Marines after Trevelyan's plan is foiled.]]\nThe helicopter pilot drops Bond and Natalya on a grassy field and leaves. The pair romantically make out for a moment before being rudely interrupted by Wade. He reveals a company of US Marines camouflaged in the vicinity has noticed them and offer to take them to safety. Here, Bond ultimately succeeds his mission.",

A poster for the then-upcoming movie was even featured on the Carlton Hotel during the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In August, The Sunday Times reported that producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]] had parted company with writer [[Richard Maibaum]], who had worked on the scripts of all but three ''Bond'' films so far, and director [[John Glen]], responsible for the previous five installments of the series. Broccoli listed among the possible directors John Landis, Ted Kotcheff, and John Byrum.\n\nSeveral plot details on the original drafts have been revealed about ''Bond 17''<nowiki/>'s plot before the subsequent re-writes that would culminate with ''GoldenEye''. The first plot line was devised by [[Michael G. Wilson]] and Alfonse Ruggiero, which sees [[James Bond (Timothy Dalton)|James Bond]] confronting a Hong Kong-based technology entrepreneur Sir Henry Lee Ching, who is using his micro-components to take control of vital mechanical devices around the world. The story's main Bond Girl was Connie Webb, thrill-seeking freelance industrial saboteur who was hired by Sir Henry to gain control of Chinese nuclear plant electronics. This first treatment was submitted in May 1990, followed by a revised script dated July 1990.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20241227125228/https://www.commander007.net/wp-content/EcrireBond/Scripting%20007%20-%20Cl%C3%A9ment%20Feutry.pdf \"Scripting 007: Behind the writing of the James Bond movies\" by Clement Feutry (Version 2.2 - Nov 30, 2024)] - Chapter 17: \"GoldenEye\", pages 1111-1149</ref>\n\nSubsequently, screenwriters William Osborne and William Davies were hired to make a new script, based on the prior outline by Wilson and Ruggerio. They submitted a script dated January 1991 with a palpably self-parodying tone. The main villain was changed from mixed Chinese-Caucasian Lee Ching to fully Caucasian Sir Henry Ferguson, whose plan now was to aid a Chinese strongman to overthrow Chinese Government with a help of a stolen stealth fighter named \"Scimitar\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20241227125228/https://www.commander007.net/wp-content/EcrireBond/Scripting%20007%20-%20Cl%C3%A9ment%20Feutry.pdf \"Scripting 007: Behind the writing of the James Bond movies\" by Clement Feutry (Version 2.2 - Nov 30, 2024)] - Chapter 17: \"GoldenEye\", pages 1152-1164</ref>\n\nCirca February 1991, the production was halted when Danjaq Holding Company sued MGM (then [[:wikipedia:MGM-Pathé Communications|MGM-Pathé Communications]]) for violating ''Bond'' distribution agreements the company made with United Artists in 1962, while denying Danjaq a share of the profits.\n\nThe ''Bond'' rights lawsuits were settled in December 1992. With Giancarlo Paretti ousted, the MGM executives took a more \"Bond-friendly\" view. However, the delay caused by the lawsuits would lead to Dalton's contract with Danjaq to expire before Eon Productions able to begin production of the next Bond film proper.\n\n===Writing===\n====Michael France====\nIn May 1993, Variety reports that Michael France has been hired to pen the new Bond adventure, Richard Smith is also brought on to plot \"future\" ''Bond'' stories (notably the unmade [[Unmade \"Reunion With Death\" (1993)|Reunion With Death]]).\n\nThe first story draft by Michael France was completed circa January 1994, although there are sources that claim it was submitted in August 1993. In it, James Bond goes to post-Cold War Russia and confronts [[w:c:unpublished-villains:Augustus_Trevelyan|Augustus Trevelyan]], his former MI6 superior who defected to Soviet Union while sacrificing the other 00 Agents' lives to do so. Augustus' villain scheme is roughly the same as in the completed story, except with different motives and other minute differences. France further revised the story in a draft dated March 1994, where Augustus, now with the code-name 001, fakes his death at Kremlin wall to defect to Soviet Union, with unaware Bond still blaming himself for the death of his mentor at present. France's third and final draft has the intro changed to a chemical plant in Bulgaria and Augustus is finally designated as a Lienz Cossack survivor.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20241227125228/https://www.commander007.net/wp-content/EcrireBond/Scripting%20007%20-%20Cl%C3%A9ment%20Feutry.pdf \"Scripting 007: Behind the writing of the James Bond movies\" by Clement Feutry (Version 2.2 - Nov 30, 2024)] - Chapter 17: \"GoldenEye\", pages 1175-1212</ref>\n\nThe early scripts are similar to the final story, but there are significant scenes that were removed, some which were reutilized in the later EON-produced Bond films:\n* Action sequence at a high-speed train at France, during which James Bond uses a Aston Martin DB7 to triumph the villain's attack.\n* Originally, the GoldenEye developers were all killed outside the Severnaya facility, with main villain utilizing a team of ex-KGB assassins, of which only really [[Xenia Onatopp|Xenia]] survives in the final film.\n* Sequence at the villain's manor, which plays out like the \"[[The Devil's Breath|Devil's Breath]]\" sequence in ''[[The World Is Not Enough (film)|The World is Not Enough]].''\n* Grand Kremlin Palace, where Bond meets [[Leonid Pushkin|Pushkin]] and Trevelyan, with the latter sending Xenia to seduce Bond afterwards.\n* James Bond infiltrating KGB Headquarters in Lubyanka, which is rewritten to the [[St. Petersburg Military Archives]] sequence.\n* James Bond going to a nuclear test site in Kazakhstan, which is replaced by the Tiger copter trap at the [[St. Petersburg Soviet Statue Graveyard|Soviet Statue Graveyard]], with the [[Kazakhstan Nuclear Test Facility|Kazakh test site]] being utilized for ''[[The World Is Not Enough (film)|The World is Not Enough]].''\n* James Bond and the Bond girl taken to a Prison Complex at Ural Mountains, which is rewritten to the [[St. Petersburg Military Archives]] sequence as with the Lubyanka sequence.\n* There is a flashback sequence to the betrayal of Trevelyan involving the Prison Complex. Here, Trevelyan tried to lead three 00-agents (007 being one of them) to be killed by Russians, only for him to kill the two 00-agents himself to win Russians over, with Bond surviving the trap.\n* After escaping the prison complex, they escape with a seaplane at a icy river. During the escape, the plane gets more and more damaged, with it sliding down the mountain without wings at the end. This sequence bears semblance to the [[Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander|Britten-Norman plane]] sequence in ''[[Spectre (film)|Spectre]]''.\n* James Bond and the Bond girl hiding at an abandoned wood mill, that gets attacked by [[Eurocopter_AS355#The_World_Is_Not_Enough_(film)|aerial saw helicopters]], which is later used for ''[[The World Is Not Enough (film)|The World is Not Enough]].''\n* James Bond and the Bond girl going to a Chinese Bank in St. Petersburg to get a clue to Trevelyan's main lair, which bears semblance to the [[La Banque Suisse de L'Industrie|Bilbao Bank]] later used in ''[[The World Is Not Enough (film)|The World is Not Enough]].''\n* James Bond having to chase the villains in St. Petersburg on a horse instead of a T-55 tank.\n* Trevelyan's main lair/the satellite control base is not located in [[Cuba]], but a Caribbean island known as \"Saint Latrelle\". The antenna is not hidden underwater and the base's underground complex is significantly larger, containing not the computer theater, but also storage and maintenance facilities for a great number of military equipment.\n* When Bond and Bond girl reach the giant antenna, they get attacked by [[MD 500 Helicopters]], with Bond forced to outmaneuver them in a old beat-up Soviet plane. Bond and the Bond girl are forced to parachute into a hole, like in 2008's ''[[Quantum of Solace (film)|Quantum of Solace]].'' Also, the MD 500 attack helicopters do appear in the 2010 video game remake of the story. In the final 1995 film, Bond's plane gets shot out of sky by a surface-to-air missile, with Xenia then attacking Bond at the plane's wreckage.\n* Bond girl programs the remaining EMP weapon to explode over the base. Instead of Trevelyan, Bond fights a henchman called Savatier at the antenna's beam steering mechanism.\n* Bond and Trevelyan's final fight occurs at the platings of the antenna cradle, after the antenna has collapsed and the EMP has destroyed the base.\n\nThe producers found Michael France's basic outline and ideas to be sound, but also deemed the completed screenplay to be too chaotic. Director [[Martin Campbell]], who was attached to the project when France was still the writer, said that he found latter's script to be indecipherable.<ref>\"Nobody Does it Better\" by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross (2020).</ref> There is also a claim that the script had to be rewritten because it was too similar with then recently released Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle, \"[[wikipedia:True Lies|True Lies]]\", but this claim has been debunked by many of the GoldenEye writers and production staff. Ultimately, new screenwriters would be sourced to rework France's script.\n\n====Jeffrey Caine====\n[[File:GE CaineScriptJul1994 IMG A.png|350px|thumb|right|First two pages of the July 1994 script by Jeffrey Caine.]]\nAfter Brosnan was announced as the new Bond, screenwriter Jeffrey Caine would submit his script adaptation on July 6th 1994 - based on the original Michael France screenplay. In it, the villain was reworked into Alexander Trevelyan, code-name 004, who is described as MI6's top agent and \"some years senior\" to Bond. There would be additional script doctoring by Kevin Wade and Bruce Feirstein. Another script was submitted dated August 12/September 12 1994, without a credited writer, just being \"based on screenplay by Michael France and Jeffrey Cane.\" It was further followed by scripts dated November 28th and December 9th - with Bruce Feirstein credited as the writer - which bear close similarity with the finished product.<ref>https://ukm.propstoreauction.com/lot-details/index/catalog/299/lot/80900<br> https://ghostarchive.org/archive/c0gmv <br>''A collection of scripts, storyboards, production paperwork and a crew jacket from the production of Martin Campbell's Bond movie GoldenEye.

The estate could have been named \"Goldeneye\" for a number of reasons. The first is that the estate is located in Oracabessa, which is [[Wikipedia:Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'golden head'. Fleming is also reported to have read Carson McCullers' novel ''Reflections In A Golden Eye'' around the time he had his house built in Jamaica. More notably, Fleming was in charge of the defence of [[Gibraltar]] during the [[Wikipedia:World War II|Second World War]]; the operation dubbed by Fleming, Operation Goldeneye. Despite persistent, but unfounded, rumours that the ill-fated ''Bond 17'' would have been titled \"Property of a Lady\", writer Alfonse Ruggiero recounted that [[Michael G.

A poster for the then-upcoming movie was even featured on the Carlton Hotel during the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In August, The Sunday Times reported that producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]] had parted company with writer [[Richard Maibaum]], who had worked on the scripts of all but three ''Bond'' films so far, and director [[John Glen]], responsible for the previous five installments of the series. Broccoli listed among the possible directors John Landis, Ted Kotcheff, and John Byrum.\n\nSeveral plot details on the original drafts have been revealed about ''Bond 17''<nowiki/>'s plot before the subsequent re-writes that would culminate with ''GoldenEye''. The first plot line was devised by [[Michael G. Wilson]] and Alfonse Ruggiero, which sees [[James Bond (Timothy Dalton)|James Bond]] confronting a Hong Kong-based technology entrepreneur Sir Henry Lee Ching, who is using his micro-components to take control of vital mechanical devices around the world. The story's main Bond Girl was Connie Webb, thrill-seeking freelance industrial saboteur who was hired by Sir Henry to gain control of Chinese nuclear plant electronics. This first treatment was submitted in May 1990, followed by a revised script dated July 1990.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20241227125228/https://www.commander007.net/wp-content/EcrireBond/Scripting%20007%20-%20Cl%C3%A9ment%20Feutry.pdf \"Scripting 007: Behind the writing of the James Bond movies\" by Clement Feutry (Version 2.2 - Nov 30, 2024)] - Chapter 17: \"GoldenEye\", pages 1111-1149</ref>\n\nSubsequently, screenwriters William Osborne and William Davies were hired to make a new script, based on the prior outline by Wilson and Ruggerio. They submitted a script dated January 1991 with a palpably self-parodying tone. The main villain was changed from mixed Chinese-Caucasian Lee Ching to fully Caucasian Sir Henry Ferguson, whose plan now was to aid a Chinese strongman to overthrow Chinese Government with a help of a stolen stealth fighter named \"Scimitar\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20241227125228/https://www.commander007.net/wp-content/EcrireBond/Scripting%20007%20-%20Cl%C3%A9ment%20Feutry.pdf \"Scripting 007: Behind the writing of the James Bond movies\" by Clement Feutry (Version 2.2 - Nov 30, 2024)] - Chapter 17: \"GoldenEye\", pages 1152-1164</ref>\n\nCirca February 1991, the production was halted when Danjaq Holding Company sued MGM (then [[:wikipedia:MGM-Pathé Communications|MGM-Pathé Communications]]) for violating ''Bond'' distribution agreements the company made with United Artists in 1962, while denying Danjaq a share of the profits.\n\nThe ''Bond'' rights lawsuits were settled in December 1992. With Giancarlo Paretti ousted, the MGM executives took a more \"Bond-friendly\" view. However, the delay caused by the lawsuits would lead to Dalton's contract with Danjaq to expire before Eon Productions able to begin production of the next Bond film proper.",

In it, James Bond goes to post-Cold War Russia and confronts [[w:c:unpublished-villains:Augustus_Trevelyan|Augustus Trevelyan]], his former MI6 superior who defected to Soviet Union while sacrificing the other 00 Agents' lives to do so. Augustus' villain scheme is roughly the same as in the completed story, except with different motives and other minute differences. France further revised the story in a draft dated March 1994, where Augustus, now with the code-name 001, fakes his death at Kremlin wall to defect to Soviet Union, with unaware Bond still blaming himself for the death of his mentor at present. France's third and final draft has the intro changed to a chemical plant in Bulgaria and Augustus is finally designated as a Lienz Cossack survivor.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20241227125228/https://www.commander007.net/wp-content/EcrireBond/Scripting%20007%20-%20Cl%C3%A9ment%20Feutry.pdf \"Scripting 007: Behind the writing of the James Bond movies\" by Clement Feutry (Version 2.2 - Nov 30, 2024)] - Chapter 17: \"GoldenEye\", pages 1175-1212</ref>\n\nThe early scripts are similar to the final story, but there are significant scenes that were removed, some which were reutilized in the later EON-produced Bond films:\n* Action sequence at a high-speed train at France, during which James Bond uses a Aston Martin DB7 to triumph the villain's attack.\n* Originally, the GoldenEye developers were all killed outside the Severnaya facility, with main villain utilizing a team of ex-KGB assassins, of which only really [[Xenia Onatopp|Xenia]] survives in the final film.\n* Sequence at the villain's manor, which plays out like the \"[[The Devil's Breath|Devil's Breath]]\" sequence in ''[[The World Is Not Enough (film)|The World is Not Enough]].''\n* Grand Kremlin Palace, where Bond meets [[Leonid Pushkin|Pushkin]] and Trevelyan, with the latter sending Xenia to seduce Bond afterwards.\n* James Bond infiltrating KGB Headquarters in Lubyanka, which is rewritten to the [[St. Petersburg Military Archives]] sequence.\n* James Bond going to a nuclear test site in Kazakhstan, which is replaced by the Tiger copter trap at the [[St. Petersburg Soviet Statue Graveyard|Soviet Statue Graveyard]], with the [[Kazakhstan Nuclear Test Facility|Kazakh test site]] being utilized for ''[[The World Is Not Enough (film)|The World is Not Enough]].''\n* James Bond and the Bond girl taken to a Prison Complex at Ural Mountains, which is rewritten to the [[St. Petersburg Military Archives]] sequence as with the Lubyanka sequence.\n* There is a flashback sequence to the betrayal of Trevelyan involving the Prison Complex. Here, Trevelyan tried to lead three 00-agents (007 being one of them) to be killed by Russians, only for him to kill the two 00-agents himself to win Russians over, with Bond surviving the trap.\n* After escaping the prison complex, they escape with a seaplane at a icy river.

The antenna is not hidden underwater and the base's underground complex is significantly larger, containing not the computer theater, but also storage and maintenance facilities for a great number of military equipment.\n* When Bond and Bond girl reach the giant antenna, they get attacked by [[MD 500 Helicopters]], with Bond forced to outmaneuver them in a old beat-up Soviet plane. Bond and the Bond girl are forced to parachute into a hole, like in 2008's ''[[Quantum of Solace (film)|Quantum of Solace]].''

    "Soundtrack": "{{main|GoldenEye (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack for GoldenEye was composed by French composer [[Éric Serra]] and released by EMI on November 14, 1995. The French composer composed and performed several synthesizer tracks, including the traditional opening sequence of the James Bond films. In a first for James Bond, the soundtrack composer himself performed his song in the closing credits (though not the first time for Eric Serra).\n\nSerra's soundtrack for the movie remains a very divisive aspect of the movie; with one camp seeing it as giving the film an unique atmosphere that even elevates the film above the other Bond films,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlTSB-7SmEM \"The Bond Movie That Sounds Like NO Other\" by The Nat Cave (@TheNatCav3)](Retrieved 07-04-2025)</ref> while others go as far as to say it is the single worst Bond movie soundtrack in the series' history.<ref>[https://www.filmtracks.com/titles/goldeneye.html Goldeneye (Eric Serra) - Filmtracks]</ref>",

At the time of its release, it was considered a flagship game for the console, and was revolutionary in First-Person Shooter history which led to many later games and series inspired by it, including the ''Bond'' series itself; It ultimately sold over 8 million units - making it the 3rd best-selling title for the N64 (behind only Nintendo's own ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Mario Kart 64'') and it is still widely regarded as the best [[James Bond Video Games|''James Bond'' video game]] as well as one of the greatest of all time. Interestingly, ''GoldenEye 007'' was originally planned to be an on-rails shooter game intended for the N64's predecessor, the Super NES. The game itself was popular enough to gain another critically acclaimed game, a spiritual successor called ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Dark Perfect Dark]'', also by Rare on the Nintendo 64, three years after its release.\n\nIn the Autumn of 2004, [[Electronic Arts]] released ''[[GoldenEye: Rogue Agent]]'' for the Xbox, Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and later the Nintendo DS. This is the first game based on the ''James Bond'' franchise in which the player does not take on the role of James Bond himself; rather they control a 00-Agent candidate (ironically named [[GoldenEye (character)|GoldenEye]]) who is recruited by [[Auric Goldfinger]], the [[List of James Bond villains|Bond Villain]] in the novel/film ''[[Goldfinger]]''. Despite its name, the title has little to do with either the film ''GoldenEye'' or its video game adaptation, and was released to mediocre reviews, and was criticized for using the \"GoldenEye\" name in an attempt to sell the game by riding on the success of Rare's game.\n\nIn 2010, Activision and Eurocom produced a [[GoldenEye 007 (2010 game)|re-imagining of the ''GoldenEye 007'' game]], albeit with major changes to the plot and graphics (Rareware had been acquired by Microsoft in 2002). Some changes include the likeness of [[Daniel Craig]] as James Bond instead of [[Pierce Brosnan]], the removal of Boris, and different level layouts. Originally a Nintendo Wii/DS exclusive, it was later released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 as ''GoldenEye: Reloaded''. It was moderately well-received, though not to the extent of the original N64 game.",
    "Trivia ": "===Similarity with other Bond stories===\n====Moonraker novel====\nIts been observed GoldenEye has similarities with the original 1955 [[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker novel]]; while they aren't 1:1 directly connected, they have some similar elements in their story structure. \n* The villains - [[Sir Hugo Drax (Literary)|Sir Hugo Drax]] and Alec Trevelyan - are both supposed British allies who end up revealed to be traitors. What's more, both of their motives are derived from things that happened during [[World War II]], with Drax motivated by Nazi Germany's loss and Trevelyan by the British repatriation of Lienz Cossacks. Also, both have halves of their faces burned, which resulted from a military operation that resulted in change of side. It should also be noted that both these villains are considered the best developed Bond villains of their perspective decades.\n* Both of villain's plans involve using a nuclear weapon to devastate London and profit from it; with Sir Drax using the Moonraker tactical missile and stockmarket trickery to reap profits from destruction, while Trevelyan is using the stolen GoldenEye EMP weapon to cover the computer hacker theft into Bank of England.\n* The Bond girl is integral in undoing the nuclear weapon in both stories; Gala Brand redirects the Moonraker missile to explode at sea, while Natalya Simonova sets of the GoldenEye's EMP's retro-rockets to make it self-destruct at earth's atmosphere.\n* Both have elaborate car chases in a major city with the Bond girl held as villain's hostage in the car that's chased; Moonraker novel has the Bond's Bentley vs. Drax's Mercedes-Benz, and GoldenEye has Bond's T-55 vs. Ourumov's GAZ Volga.\n\n====Never Say Never Again (+ Thunderball)====\nThere are quite a few story-line similarities with the plot of the unofficial 1983 Bond film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.\n* M is depicted being disdainful of Bond's archaic nature. GoldenEye's M deems Bond a \"sexist misogynistic dinosaur\" and a relic of the cold war, while NSNA's M deems that Bond is a under-performer not up the standards of his MI6 reign.\n* Villains are more complicated than typical Bond villain. GoldenEye's Alec Trevelyan has (somewhat) sympathetic motives and complicated relationship with Bond; while NSNA's Maximillian Largo exhibits rather realistic psychopathic and emotionally manipulative tendencies.\n* France/Monaco is featured as a notable setting; with Monte Carlo Casino being one of the places Bond visits, although in NSNA its not expressly meant to be the Monte Carlo Casino.\n* Both feature degree of computer technology.\n* Xenia Ontatopp's unhinged behavior mirrors that of [[Fatima Blush]].\n* Both have scenes in which Bond uses a [[Laser Wristwatch|laser wristwatch]] to escape containment.\n* Both feature a pencil gadget; the pencil projectile launcher in NSNA and the exploding pen in GoldenEye.\n* Both films have Bond return to a car not seen in a while. (The Bentley in NSNA, the DB5 in GoldenEye)\n* Both films are composed by French composers; Michel LeGrand for NSNA and Eric Serra for GoldenEye.\n* Both begin with a military operation in which Bond is betrayed. Except in NSNA the betrayal is near-immediate, while in GoldenEye it takes a while before Bond realized that Trevelyan betrayed him in the opening mission.\n* Both have Bond's health being evaluated near the beginning of the film. Bond is sent to Shrublands in NSNA, while Caroline performs a psychiatric evaluation in Monaco to Bond.\n* Both feature villain using high-ranking officer credentials gaining access to a well-guarded vault for controls of a nuclear weapon; General Ourumov in GoldenEye and Jack Petachi in NSNA.\n* While more connected to the original 1965 ''[[Thunderball]]'', Xenia's theft of Tiger mirrors the theft of the V-Force [[Avro Vulcan]] bomber.\n* Both feature Bond in green jungle fatigues. NSNA's Bond has them at the beginning, while GoldenEye's Bond has them by the finale.\n* Both have Bond driving a motorcycle, which never happened in other Bond movies prior to GoldenEye.\n\n===Other trivia===\n*While this is the first appearance of [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[James Bond (Pierce Brosnan)|James Bond]], he was actually picked to replace [[Roger Moore]] in the 1987 film ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', but due to his contract with the television show, ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_Steele Remington Steele]'' (which is known for launching his career prior to becoming 007), he had to drop out of the film and the role was ultimately given to [[Timothy Dalton]], instead. \n**Indeed, the pre-titles Arkhangelsk sequence takes place in 1986, when Brosnan was originally meant to begin his Bond tenure.\n*''GoldenEye'' was the first ''James Bond'' film to have filmed on location inside the former Soviet Union (Russia), a country which had banned all sixteen previous movies.\n*Earlier on the year of ''GoldenEye''<nowiki/>'s release, [[Alan Cumming]] (who portrayed [[Janus Syndicate|Janus]]' computer whiz [[Boris Grishenko]]) and [[Minnie Driver]] (who portrayed [[Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane)|Zukovsky]]'s mistress [[Irina (Minnie Driver)|Irina]]) had shared several scenes together in the film adaptation of Maeve Binchy's romantic/friendship novel ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_Friends_(1995_film) Circle of Friends].'' In ''GoldenEye'', however, they never appeared together onscreen. Driver also had no spoken lines in ''GoldenEye'' except singing the lyrics of \"Stand by Your Man\" by Tammy Wynette.[[File:GoldenEye (Amazon digital 2023).jpg|thumb|187x187px|The 2023 Amazon Digital promotion image of the movie shows a genuine \"GoldenEye\"]]\n*Ironically, a promotional pictur<nowiki/>e for the film exists of an iris with a golden color, hence the name \"GoldenEye\".\n*For a time it was rumoured that Brosnan's contract specifically stated that he was not allowed to wear a full tuxedo in other films and that Brosnan had apparently worked around this in the film ''[[Wikipedia:The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' by leaving his tie untied during a black-tie ball, thus not wearing a full tuxedo. This rumor turned out to be false.\n*Minnie Driver (Irina) and [[Izabella Scorupco]] ([[Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco)|Natalya Simonova]]) had appeared alongside American actor [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_O%27Donnell Chris O'Donnell] in different movies. Driver in ''Circle of Friends'' and Scorupco in ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_Limit Vertical Limit]''.

Pierce Brosnan attended the premiere of ''Vertical Limit'' and posed with O'Donnell and the latter's ''Vertical Limit'' co-star [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Paxton Bill Paxton] for a photograph during the event.\n*''GoldenEye'' features the highest bungee jump from a structure in a movie, performed by British stuntman Wayne Michaels. The drop was more than 722ft. At the time, it was the highest bungee jump of any kind.\n* Joe Don Baker returned as CIA agent Jack Wade in the sequel ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'': his previous appearance in the Bond films was as the villain [[Brad Whitaker]] in ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. Baker had played a similar character, also a CIA agent, for ''GoldenEye'' director [[Martin Campbell]] in the 1985 BBC television drama ''Edge of Darkness''. Baker became the second actor to portray both Bond's main adversary and Bond's ally (after [[Charles Gray]] who portrayed [[Dikko Henderson (Charles Gray)|a murdered MI6 contact]] in Tokyo in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' and would later play [[Blofeld (classic film continuity)|Blofeld]] in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''), and the first one to play the ally character twice after previously played a different main villain character.\n*Maurice Binder, the title sequence designer for most of the ''James Bond'' films since ''[[Dr. No]]'', died in 1991. The job of title designer for ''GoldenEye'' as well as several future ''James Bond'' films was then passed to Daniel Kleinman.\n*Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli died shortly after the film was released. He had been too ill but could visit the Pinewood studios by being a consulting Producer. The next ''Bond'' film, ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', was dedicated to his memory.\n*This is the first ''James Bond'' film where the MI6 Headquarters scenes are being filmed and set in its [[SIS Building|actual real-life building]].\n*This is also the first film where MI6 is referred as such. Previously it was called British Secret Service, as officially MI6 did not exist before going public in 1994.\n*The uniform of the Canadian Admiral was incorrect. The admiral was shown with two bars and an executive curl on the cuffs of his tunic. As this was filmed in 1995, the admiral's uniform should have one solid bar on the cuffs, and three maple leaves on the shoulders, and without the wings on the sleeve. The Canadian Navy would have these restored in 2010.\n*Boris the programmer's global tracking software features the outline of a united Czechoslovakia on its map, even though the country had (peacefully) split into the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 1993, two years before that part of the film takes place.\n*Xenia Onatopp is shown to kill men by squeezing their chests with her thighs. In the previous Bond film [[The Living Daylights]], [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]] reviews a range of Soviet KGB female assassins, one of which, [[Ula Yarkhov]], kills using her thighs.\n*''GoldenEye'' has the distinction of being the first - and currently, the only - EON-produced ''James Bond'' film to include a semi-explicit sex scene, specifically the scene in which Xenia kills the Canadian Naval Admiral while making love to him. Despite this, the film was still released with a PG-13 rating.\n*In a scene set at Q lab, Bond and Q test an exploding pen which successfully works, prompting Bond to quip, \"''The writing's on the wall?''\". The phrase would later become the title of the main theme to ''[[Spectre (film)|Spectre]]'', starring [[James Bond (Daniel Craig)|Daniel Craig as Bond]].\n*This was the only Brosnan ''Bond'' film not to be released in the same year as a ''Austin Powers'' movie, the movie series that parodied ''James Bond''.\n*The first ''James Bond'' film to be released in the 1990s and the first to be released in the two year chronological odd-numbered gap.",

Baker had played a similar character, also a CIA agent, for ''GoldenEye'' director [[Martin Campbell]] in the 1985 BBC television drama ''Edge of Darkness''. Baker became the second actor to portray both Bond's main adversary and Bond's ally (after [[Charles Gray]] who portrayed [[Dikko Henderson (Charles Gray)|a murdered MI6 contact]] in Tokyo in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' and would later play [[Blofeld (classic film continuity)|Blofeld]] in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''), and the first one to play the ally character twice after previously played a different main villain character.\n*Maurice Binder, the title sequence designer for most of the ''James Bond'' films since ''[[Dr. No]]'', died in 1991. The job of title designer for ''GoldenEye'' as well as several future ''James Bond'' films was then passed to Daniel Kleinman.\n*Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli died shortly after the film was released. He had been too ill but could visit the Pinewood studios by being a consulting Producer. The next ''Bond'' film, ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', was dedicated to his memory.\n*This is the first ''James Bond'' film where the MI6 Headquarters scenes are being filmed and set in its [[SIS Building|actual real-life building]].\n*This is also the first film where MI6 is referred as such. Previously it was called British Secret Service, as officially MI6 did not exist before going public in 1994.\n*The uniform of the Canadian Admiral was incorrect. The admiral was shown with two bars and an executive curl on the cuffs of his tunic. As this was filmed in 1995, the admiral's uniform should have one solid bar on the cuffs, and three maple leaves on the shoulders, and without the wings on the sleeve. The Canadian Navy would have these restored in 2010.\n*Boris the programmer's global tracking software features the outline of a united Czechoslovakia on its map, even though the country had (peacefully) split into the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 1993, two years before that part of the film takes place.\n*Xenia Onatopp is shown to kill men by squeezing their chests with her thighs. In the previous Bond film [[The Living Daylights]], [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]] reviews a range of Soviet KGB female assassins, one of which, [[Ula Yarkhov]], kills using her thighs.\n*''GoldenEye'' has the distinction of being the first - and currently, the only - EON-produced ''James Bond'' film to include a semi-explicit sex scene, specifically the scene in which Xenia kills the Canadian Naval Admiral while making love to him. Despite this, the film was still released with a PG-13 rating.\n*In a scene set at Q lab, Bond and Q test an exploding pen which successfully works, prompting Bond to quip, \"''The writing's on the wall?''\". The phrase would later become the title of the main theme to ''[[Spectre (film)|Spectre]]'', starring [[James Bond (Daniel Craig)|Daniel Craig as Bond]].\n*This was the only Brosnan ''Bond'' film not to be released in the same year as a ''Austin Powers'' movie, the movie series that parodied ''James Bond''.\n*The first ''James Bond'' film to be released in the 1990s and the first to be released in the two year chronological odd-numbered gap.",
