Whoever she was, I must have scared the living daylights out of her.|[[James Bond (Timothy Dalton)|James Bond]] to [[Saunders]]|The Living Daylights}}\n'''''The Living Daylights''''' is a 1987 spy film and the fifteenth film in the [[James Bond films|''James Bond'' film series]] produced by [[EON Productions]]. It was the first of two films to star [[Timothy Dalton]] as the fictional [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (Timothy Dalton)|James Bond]], and is also the first Bond film to have [[Caroline Bliss]] as Miss Moneypenny, replacing [[Lois Maxwell]]. The story was inspired by [[Ian Fleming]]'s eponymous [[Octopussy and The Living Daylights#\"The Living Daylights\"|short story]], first published in [[007 franchise timeline#1962|1962]]. It was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]], his stepson [[Michael G. Wilson]], and Broccoli's daughter [[Barbara Broccoli]]. This was the last film to make use of an Ian Fleming story title until the release of ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' in [[007 franchise timeline#2006|2006]].",
    "Plot summary": "===Pre-title sequence: Gibraltar===\nIn the prologue, three skydiving [[00 Agents]] are tasked with penetrating radar installations atop the Rock of [[Gibraltar]] as part of a [[Ministry of Defence]] training exercise. [[002 (The Living Daylights)|002]] is captured almost immediately upon landing by the SAS, while [[James Bond (Timothy Dalton)|007]] and [[004 (The Living Daylights)|004]] start scaling the cliffs. \n\nAs they ascend, an [[Imposter 00|assassin]] sends a tag reading ''Smert Shpionam'' down 004's climbing rope before cutting it, sending the spy to his death. Bond hears the assassination and goes to investigate, finding the body of 004. Bond then hears gunshots from a nearby Land Rover - which is loaded with explosive munitions - with the assassin boarding it to flee the area. Bond gives chase and leaps onto the Land Rover, with the munitions catching on fire when a gate guard shoots at it.\n\nThe struggle concludes with the explosives-laden Land Rover careening down Gibraltar's narrow roads and then into the air. Bond escapes with his reserve parachute and lands on a yacht interrupting a lady while the assassin is killed when the Land Rover explodes in mid-air.\n\n===Koskov's defection===\n[[File:Bondwiki TLD87 Bond Saunders WA2000 pic1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bond and Saunders getting ready to intercept the \"KGB sniper\" targeting Koskov.]]\nThe early part of the film has much of the original short story's plot: Bond assists [[Saunders]], head of [[Secret Intelligence Service#MI6 intelligence sections|Section V]], in the defection to the West of a devious [[KGB]] [[General Koskov|General Georgi Koskov]], acting as a counter-sniper to protect Koskov during his intermission escape from a concert hall in [[Bratislava]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. \n\nBond notices that the sniper targeting Koskov is the beautiful female cellist from the orchestra, [[Kara Milovy]]. Bond begins to suspect that something wrong, as he notices that the female sniper isn't handling the rifle properly. Following his instinct, Bond only shoots the rifle out of the woman's hands, sparing her life. Saunders is displeased with Bond's decision, but they have to go meet Koskov, who has reached the safehouse.\n\nBond orders Saunders to dispose the rifle, as he takes Koskov to the Trans-Siberian Gas Terminal with [[Audi 200 (C3)|their Audi]]. While driving the car to the terminal, Koskov inquires if Bond killed the female sniper, but does not anwser, Koskov assuming that Bond did so. At the terminal, [[Rosika Miklos]] helps Bond to get Koskov aboard the [[PIG Pod]], which transports the defector to an Austrian Gasometer, where [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]] then helps Koskov board a [[Harrier Jump Jet]] to fly to England and complete the defection.\n\nBond reaches Saunders in the car and the two cross the border without incident. However, Saunders berates Bond disobeying the orders, while Bond sharply rationalizes to his actions, telling that if [[M (Robert Brown)|M]] doesn't like it, then he can discharge Bond from MI6 service.\n\n===Q Lab and Blayden safe house===\nBack in England, at the Universal Exports Headquarters, Bond and [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]] are going over KGB assassins to identify the Opera House shooter, with no success. [[Miss Moneypenny (Caroline Bliss)|Miss Moneypenny]] interrupts, telling to Bond that M expects 007 at the [[Blayden House]].\n\n[[File:Bondwiki Koskov Blayden chat photo1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gen. Koskov telling the Blayden House attendants about Pushkin's SMERSH operation.]]\nAt the Blayden House, General Koskov informs [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] that the KGB is being run by power-hungry [[Leonid Pushkin|General Pushkin]]. According to Koskov, Pushkin has revived the old policy of ''Smert Shpionam'' — literally, ''Death to Spies'' ([[SMERSH]]), a programme of Western spy assassinations — and as such Pushkin needs to be eliminated. Although Bond remains skeptical, the story sounds plausible to the higher ups, particularly following the recent murder of Bond's partner at the Gibraltar training exercise. \n\nShortly afterwards the KGB, in person of the assassin [[Necros]], raids the safe-house where British Intelligence hide Koskov. After murdering a chef, he engages in a brutal fight with an agent in the kitchen and after knocking him unconscious, lobs grenades disguised as milk bottles at two guards, knocking them out, and lobs a second at another agent on the stairs, killing him. After briefly holding a stenographer and holding Koskov hostage, he snatches Koskov back East using the disguise of a doctor’s outfit and a [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|Red Cross helicopter]].\n\n===Czechoslovakia===\nFor his mission to kill Pushkin at a trade conference in [[wikipedia:Tangier|Tangier]], Morocco, [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]] supplies Bond with a new [[Aston Martin]] and an electric key-finder able to both release stun gas or explode. Bond doubts the ''Smert Shpionam'' theory and begins suspecting that Koskov's defection and recapture were staged. \n\n[[File:Bondwiki LDL87 Vantage Jump1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|James Bond's Vantage jettisoning over the Czechoslovak VB.]]\nBond returns to Bratislava, presenting himself to Kara Milovy as Koskov's friend and discovers that Kara is in fact Koskov's girlfriend, who is under KGB surveillance. The pair flee to [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], in the weaponized Aston Martin, pursued by KGB and Czechoslovak Police (''Veřejná bezpečnost'' or VB — ''Public Security''). Bond, however, is forced to destroy the car, whereupon he and Milovy sled down a snow-covered hill in the Kara's cello case.\n\n===Austria===\nAfter the opera in Vienna Bond excuses himself from Milovy to meet Saunders in a café. Saunders has investigated Koskov's story and has discovered a tenuous link between him and a greedy arms dealer, \"General\" [[Brad Whitaker]]. Kara's Stradivarius cello, though bought by Koskov, was funded by him. \n\nThe military enthusiast is merely a self-styled general, as he has been expelled from [[wikipedia:United States Military Academy West Point|West Point]] for cheating, and has never served as a military officer. Whitaker has arranged to supply the KGB with Western high-technology weapons through Koskov, and the latter is attempting to deliver the down payment in diamonds. As Pushkin is investigating Koskov and cancels the arms deal with Whittaker, the pair wants him dead. Because Necros is known to the KGB, Koskov intends to deal with Pushkin by having the British kill him. Whitaker agrees but wants Necros to ensure that Pushkin is dead if Bond hasn't done so before the end of the conference.\n\nAs Saunders leaves the café he is killed by Necros, who detonates a bomb slamming the sliding door of the café onto Saunders. Necros leaves behind a balloon with the words ''Smert Shpionam'' on it, unaware that Bond already suspects the true motives behind the trail of clues lain for him. Bond returns to Milovy, and they immediately leave for Tangier, [[Morocco]].\n\n===Tangier===\nBond confronts Pushkin, who says the KGB deactivated ''Smert Shpionam'' in 1967, and that they had nothing to do with the recent deaths of the British agents. Pushkin also reveals that Koskov is actually guilty of embezzling Soviet government funds. This confirms Bond's suspicions that a third party is behind the plot. \n\n[[File:Bondwiki TLD87 Bond Tangiers assassination.jpg|thumb|right|250px|James Bond carrying out the fake assassination of Leonid Pushkin.]]\nBond and Pushkin decide to let Koskov progress with his scheme by faking Pushkin's assassination as he speaks at the convention, just seconds before Necros, who had also infiltrated the convention, could kill Pushkin. Bond escapes from the police and is picked up by [[Felix Leiter (John Terry)|Felix Leiter]], who is observing Pushkin in Tangier.\n\nMeanwhile Milovy contacts Whitaker's home and Koskov convinces her that Bond is a KGB Agent looking to kill him. She assists in capturing Bond for him by drugging Bonds drink, causing him to faint out! She grasps too late that Koskov has fooled her and had intended her being killed in his defection. After being captured by Koskov, Bond and Milovy are flown to a Soviet air base in [[Afghanistan]], at the height of Soviet occupation.\n\n===Afghanistan===\nImprisoned on arrival, they escape, helped by Bond's key-finder, and free a prisoner to be hanged the next day. The prisoner is [[Kamran Shah]], leader of the local ''[[Mujahideen]]''. Bond discovers that Whitaker and Koskov are paying diamonds for a large shipment of [[Heroin|opium]], which would turn a profit within days of distribution in the streets of the US, and so continue supplying the Soviets with arms.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki TLD87 Bond AK Hercules.jpg|thumb|left|300px|James Bond firing the AKMS from the Hercules to keep Soviets at bay.]]\nThe Mujahideen help Bond and Milovy infiltrate the air base. Bond plants a bomb in the back of the cargo airplane transporting the drugs, but Koskov recognises him. Bond hijacks the airplane, while the Mujahideen attack the airbase. Milovy, at the last minute, joins Bond in the airplane take off and assumes the controls while Bond leaves to defuse his bomb. \n\nNecros, however, has stowed away on board, and attacks Bond. Milovy accidentally opens the cargo door, and Bond and Necros are sucked out, on the cargo net holding the opium; Necros and Bond fight. Necros is left hanging from Bond's boot. Bond cuts his bootlaces, dropping Necros to his death.\n\nBond manages to find the bomb amidst a slew of bags and defuses it with just two seconds left on the fuse. Milovy flies over Kamran Shah's Mujahideen, who are being pursued by Soviet soldiers across a bridge. Bond reactivates the bomb and drops it onto the bridge, killing the Soviets, helping the Mujahideen win their battle. However, soon after their gunfire-punctured fuel tanks deplete, and as there is no place to land Bond and Milovy use the release chute on the jeep to extract themselves as the airplane crashes in Pakistani territory.\n\n=== Showdown ===\nWith Leiter's help Bond infiltrates Whitaker's residence, and pops in as \"General\" Whitaker is playing a battle in his terms. When Bond tells him that the opium is burned, Whitaker is determined to kill him. He takes out a heavy assault rifle with a shield. When Bond uses up all of his bullets, Whitaker makes a glib remark: \"Well, you've had your 8, now I'll have my 80!\", taunting Bond with remarks about new technology with weapons while hunting him through his amory.\n\nBond's key-finder saves him again, when he uses the plastic explosive to topple a bust of Wellington onto Whitaker, killing him. The KGB save Bond's life when agents, led by General Pushkin, burst in and kill the Whitaker guard who had cornered Bond. General Koskov is found by KGB agents, and, while not killed, he is to be flown back to [[Moscow]] \"in the diplomatic bag\", by Pushkin's order.\n\n===Epilogue===\n[[File:Bondwiki TLD87 Bond and Kara about to kiss at the end.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bond and Kara together at the end.]]\nIn London, Milovy performs with an orchestra with M, now-diplomat General Gogol and General Pushkin attending. M reveals that Gogol has persuaded the Soviet government to allow her to perform in both the Soviet Union and in Great Britain. Kamran Shah and his men arrive but miss most of the performance. Milovy introduces Shah and his men to Gogol and the Russians before retiring to her dressing room. Bond then surprises her there and the two share a kiss.",

Wilson]] began brainstorming the next James Bond film during the later half of that year. Although [[Roger Moore]] had not yet quit the role of James Bond - announcing it later on December 3rd 1985 - it was evident that a new, younger actor was planned to assume the role of the iconic super spy in the next 007 adventure.\n\nMaibaum and Wilson conceptualized the original 15th Bond movie to be a kind of prequel to the series. In it, younger adult James Bond would transfer from his duties as a military attaché in Austria to a agent for the MI6. Not quite the super spy he would come to be known as, he would instead partner up with the present 007 - Bart Trevor (also known as Burton Trevor in earlier drafts) - on a mission to the notorious Golden Triangle, where he would come face to face with a opium warlord known as General Kwang.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20241227125228/https://www.commander007.net/wp-content/EcrireBond/Scripting%20007%20-%20Cl%C3%A9ment%20Feutry.pdf \"Scripting 007: Behind the writing of the James Bond movies\" by Clement Feutry (Version 2.2 - Nov 30, 2024)] - Chapter 15: \"The Living Daylights\", pages 958-976.</ref>\n\nAlthough Maibaum and Wilson thought they had something special, the story idea was vetoed by producer Albert R.

While Dana and Barbara Broccoli, as well as director [[John Glen]] were enthused by Neill, the series' chief producer [[Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli]] found him unsuitable for the role. In hindsight, Neill was grateful that EON never tried to re-approach him after the screen-tests.<ref>[https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/sam-neill-james-bond-i-wouldnt-have-taken-role/ Sam Neill on James Bond: ‘I Wouldn’t Have Taken the Role’] by Don Kaye, Den of Geek (June 14, 2022)</ref>\n\n[[File:Bondwiki Brosnan Signing mid-1980s.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Pierce Brosnan (accompanied by Cubby Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson) had signed for the role of James Bond, before contract dispute involving Remington Steele forced him to drop out.]] \nRegarding Pierce Brosnan, Cubby Broccoli had set his sights on him early on, with the two having met in 1981 during the filming of [[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]], in which Brosnan's then-wife [[Cassandra Harris]] played a small role. Prior to the casting process, Brosnan had starred in [[Wikipedia:National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]'s crime thriller/romantic comedy television series ''[[wikipedia:Remington Steele|Remington Steele]]'', which was due to be cancelled after the 1985-86 television season. \n\nBrosnan had signed for the role of James Bond in mid-1986. However, when it became public that Brosnan was the favorite for the next Bond, it inexplicably caused an uptick in interest for Remington Steele. NBC decided to renew Remington Steele, and by appealing to Brosnan's contractual obligations for the role, the network brute-forced him to return for Remington Steele and to withdraw the EON signing. Brosnan would have to wait until Dalton chose to not renew his contract in 1993, which would give his second chance and ultimately be announced as the then-new James Bond actor in June 1994. Brosnan's first James Bond feature ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]'' would be released in November 1995.\n\nBefore being cast as Roger Moore's successor as James Bond, [[Timothy Dalton]] had originally been considered for the role of James Bond twice. First time as a replacement for [[Sean Connery]], but had ruled himself out as being too young. He had been considered again when [[Roger Moore]] decided to leave the role prior to ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', and was apparently all but signed to portray the character when Moore changed his mind at the last moment. When asked for third time for this movie, he initially refused, but relented after Pierce Brosnan was forced to withdraw. Finally, on August 6, 1986, it was announced that Timothy Dalton would be the new James Bond.\n\n====The other actors====\n[[Maryam d'Abo]], however, earned her [[Kara Milovy]] role with her screen test with Brosnan; she was not in the running for a role in the film, but had been hired to act opposite the 007 contenders; impressed, the producers gave her the part.\n\n[[Lois Maxwell]], who had played [[Miss Moneypenny]] in fourteen consecutive films from [[Dr. No]] to [[A View to a Kill]], left the series along with [[Roger Moore]]. She was replaced by British actress [[Caroline Bliss]], who was 25 at the time of filming.\n\nOriginally, the KGB general set up by [[General Koskov]] was to be [[General Gogol]]. However, actor [[Walter Gotell]] was seriously ill during that time and was unable to handle a major role. Thus the character of [[Leonid Pushkin]] replaced Gogol, with the latter appearing only briefly at the end of the film, having transferred to the Soviet diplomatic service. This is Gogol's final appearance in a James Bond film (Gotell died in 1997). The similarity between Pushkin and Gogol is emphasized by the fact that Pushkin is seen accompanied by a beautiful blonde, much as Gogol was in his early appearances.\n\nThis film also marks the final appearance of [[Geoffrey Keen]] as British Defense Minister [[Sir Frederick Gray]], who had appeared six times in a row from 1977's [[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]] onward, up until this film\n\nActors Lee Van Cleef and Jack Palance were considered for the role of Brad Whitaker, with character actor [[Joe Don Baker]] ultimately getting the role. Joe Don Baker would later reappear in ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]'' and ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies (film)|Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', as a different character, [[Jack Wade]], Bond's CIA liaison and replacement for [[Felix Leiter]].\n\nActors Frederick Warder and Glyn Baker were cast as Agents 004 and 002, who appear in the opening sequence, because of their resemblance to former Bonds [[Roger Moore]] and [[George Lazenby]] respectively. This trick was intended to keep the audience guessing for the first few minutes of the film as to who the new James Bond would be.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:John Barry.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Living Daylights marks the final time with John Barry composing a Bond movie's soundtrack.]] \nThe soundtrack for the The Living Daylights was composed by [[John Barry]], and would be the last James Bond film he composed. The title song, \"The Living Daylights,\" was performed by the Norwegian pop group [[a-ha]]. The music video for the single was also partially shot at the [[Pinewood Studios]], where many of the grandest sequences in Bond cinema - including interior set for Stromberg's tanker in The Spy Who Loved Me - were made.\n\nThe Pet Shop Boys had originally agreed to compose the title song for the movie, but withdrew when they were unallowed to do the entirety of the soundtrack. John Barry also commissioned the band The Pretenders to compose the two tracks \"[[If There Was a Man]]\" (the end credits theme) and \"[[Where Has Everybody Gone?]]\" (the song that constantly plays on [[Necros]]' Walkman), which were also included in the soundtrack. There is also the song \"Sacred Heart\" by Chris Blackwell (De Wolfe library) that shortly plays at the Q-lab during the demonstration of the [[Ghetto Blaster]].",

    "Reception and legacy": "[[File:12975_original.jpg|255px|thumb|Teaser poster.]]\n''The Living Daylights'' revitalized the Bond franchise in the late ’80s with a grounded tone and a more human spy. Though not universally loved upon release, its reputation has only improved, and it’s now seen as one of the most important transitional films in Bond history.\n\n===Critical reception and box office===\nBox office-wise, ''The Living Daylights'' did well, earning about $191 million globally, which made it a hit, though not a huge blockbuster. It did better than its previous film - ''[[A View to a Kill (film)|A View to a Kill]]'' - showing that moviegoers were looking for a new and updated Bond experience.\n\nWhen the film was first released, the reviews at the time were mostly positive, but a few were careful in their praise. Critics liked how the movie brought back a more serious and realistic feel after the more over-the-top [[Roger Moore]] years. They especially liked [[Timothy Dalton]]'s acting, which showed Bond as a more dark, realistic, and morally complicated character, similar to how [[Ian Fleming]] wrote him. However, some people thought Dalton's acting was too serious or lacked humor, especially when compared to Moore's more playful style. The action scenes, stunts, and camera work were highly praised. However the film's villains - Koskov and Whitaker - weren't particularly well-received.\n\n===Legacy and Reappraisal===\nIn the 21st century, the film's reputation has grown a lot. Many fans and critics now consider it one of the best Bond movies after [[Sean Connery]]'s era. \n\nTimothy Dalton's portrayal in ''The Living Daylights'' changed how Bond was perceived, making him a more serious and morally complicated spy. This change started Bond's move towards a more realistic approach, and the subsequent [[Licence to Kill]] took that direction even further. This movie helped to set the stage for future actors like [[Pierce Brosnan]] and especially [[Daniel Craig]]. Many today believe Dalton brought a modern feel to the Bond character long before it was expected, and his approach works well with the more thoughtful, post-Cold War versions of Bond that came later.",

    "Trivia": "===Octopussy connection===\n* The title is taken from the posthumous Ian Fleming-penned collection of short stories ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights|Octopussy and the Living Daylights]]'', although it only adapt one of its short stories, \"The Living Daylights\" into Koskov's pipeline-smuggling defection scene. The title of the original Fleming work is also used for the 13th Bond film, ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'', released 4 years prior to ''The Living Daylights'' with [[Roger Moore]] still playing Bond back then, and the storyline contains elements adapted from 2 of the short stories, \"Octopussy\" and \"The Property of a Lady\". Despite both films having the title taken from the short stories collection, ''Octopussy'' and ''The Living Daylights'' have no relations to each other in matters of plotlines or continuities, though they have notable similarities:\n** Both have [[Afghanistan]] as pivotal part of the storyline's element. One of ''Octopussy''<nowiki/>'s main villains, [[Kamal Khan]], is a secluded Afghan nobleman. ''The Living Daylights'' features Soviet troops attempting to invade Afghanistan with Western weapons, only to be foiled by James Bond with the aid of Kara Milovy and the local Mujahideen led by Kamran Shah.\n** Both feature a 00 agent being killed by an associate of the main enemy. In ''Octopussy'', a [[009 (Octopussy)|009]] is stabbed from distance by knife-throwing criminals [[Mischka]] and [[Grischka]]. In ''The Living Daylights'', a [[004 (The Living Daylights)|004]] falls from a great height while he attempts to climb the rocks of Gibraltar, only for [[Imposter 00|a fake 00]] to pass the note ''Smert Shpionam'' and cut off the rope used for the climbing. Bond later kills these assassins in the following retaliation.\n** Both feature General Gogol in separate positions. During ''Octopussy'', Gogol was still a then-incumbent KGB superior. In ''The Living Daylights'', his position was succeeded by General Leonid Pushkin, and Gogol himself was transferred to the Soviet Diplomatic Service who then granted Kara Milovy a visa for international tours and future trips.\n** Both films have two main villains working together with heavy weaponries and large-scale invasions as their core motives, with one of them being a rogue Soviet military officer who was eventually cornered by his superior. In ''Octopussy'', Kamal Khan conspires with a renegade Russian Army officer [[General Orlov]] to detonate an atomic bomb in U.S. Air Base Feldstadt, West Germany, allowing Soviet troops to seize the entire Western bloc. In ''The Living Daylights'', General Koskov embezzles Soviet funds to purchase large supply of state-of-the-art weaponries from illegal arms dealer [[Brad Whitaker]], where the weapons would be used to ease the ongoing Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n** Both films were directed by [[John Glen]] and scored by [[John Barry]], with ''The Living Daylights'' being Barry's last work in a Bond film and the only time he cameoed in such film (uncredited, as a Viennese orchestra conductor).\n** Both films feature scenes where James Bond checks into a luxurious hotel which was previously a royal palace. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Niwas_Palace Shiv Niwas] in ''Octopussy'' and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_Schwarzenberg Palais Schwarzenberg] in ''The Living Daylights'').\n** Both films feature scenes where Q sees Bond's main opponents himself. During the raid at Monsoon Palace towards the ending of ''Octopussy'', Bond and Q sees Kamal Khan abducts Octopussy with Bond following from behind after dropping at Khan's study. ''The Living Daylights'' marks the first time Q directly interacts with the main villain, welcoming Koskov and aiding him to board a British aircraft after the latter entering Austria by way of pipeline smuggling during the latter's \"defection\". \n** Both films are succeeded with 2 years-gap followups with the word \"'''kill'''\" in the titles. ''Octopussy'' is followed by ''[[A View to a Kill (film)|A View to a Kill]]'', and ''The Living Daylights'' is followed by ''[[Licence to Kill (film)|Licence to Kill]]''.\n** Both films featured relatively small roles played by [[Peter Porteous]]. He played [[Lenkin|a Russian jewellery forger]] in league with Orlov in ''Octopussy'' and later a Czech pipeline gasworks supervisor whom Bond's ally [[Rosika Miklos]] tricks into making love while Koskov's \"defection\" is being set into motion in ''The Living Daylights''. Porteous has no speaking lines in the latter film.\n** In both films, each of the main adversaries are defeated in separate occurrences from Bond's success in preventing execution of their master plans. At the climax of ''Octopussy'', in '''a day or two''' '''after disarming the atomic bomb''' planted by General Orlov (who has been shot dead by East German border guards and cornered by KGB superior General Gogol before [[Octopussy (Maud Adams)|Octopussy]]'s circus arrival at Feldstadt) and Kamal Khan inside Octopussy's circus, Bond follows Octopussy and her cult back to India in pursuit of Khan and his personal aide [[Gobinda]] who then abduct Octopussy and attempt to flee the country, only to be stopped mid-air by Bond with Gobinda fell off the plane from extreme heights after a melee with Bond, Octopussy being rescued by Bond after the latter jams Khan's plane engines, and Khan killed in the ensuing crash due to the engine's damage. During ''The Living Daylights'' final battle, that might occurred '''several hours or days''' '''after Bond's foiling of opium shipment to Whitaker and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan''', Bond defeats Whitaker by activating an explosive inside a [[Philips Key Finder|magnetized keychain]] attached into a bust of the Duke of Wellington, which then crushed on the weapons dealer, killing him. General Pushkin apprehends Koskov and his remaining accomplices in the same spot soon afterwards, intending to bring him back to Moscow \"in a diplomatic bag\".\n** Both films have blonde Bond Girls: [[Magda]] in ''Octopussy'' and Kara Milovy in ''The Living Daylights''.\n** James Bond defeats the main villains' primary henchmen in both films, with the fight being set mid-air on the plane that would be crashed in a desert right after Bond and his girl escape on time. In ''Octopussy'', while dangling on Kamal Khan's plane to kill Bond with his knife, Gobinda plunges to his death after Bond snapped the plane's antenna into his nose, causing Gobinda to lose balance and slips off the plane, meeting his demise. In ''The Living Daylights'', the fight between Bond and Necros culminates with both dangling on a cargo net that expands outside of the Hercules carrying the opium after the back door is accidentally opened. Necros then slips down but then he firmly grips on Bond's boots to avoid falling down. Eventually, as a token of vengeance to Necros who had killed MI6 Vienna head operative [[Saunders]], Bond cuts off his boot's lace, sending Necros to death.\n===Other Trivia===\n* The first Bond film to star Timothy Dalton as James Bond and Caroline Bliss as Miss Moneypenny.\n* ''The Living Daylights'' marks the first time a headbutt is used in a James Bond movie, as well as the first use of a variation of the word \"fuck\" on-screen (by [[Timothy Dalton]], although he is not audible at the time).\n* This is the final James Bond film with a main storyline set during and completely related to the Cold War. The 16th film, [[Licence to Kill (film)|Licence to Kill]], is the last one set during the Cold War but its story is not related to it, being primarily about South American drug cartels. In the 17th film, ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]'', the Cold War only provided the background of the pre-title sequence, while the remainder of the story is set years after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n* Prior to this movie, the plot involving a fake Soviet defector inspired by [[Wikipedia:Vitaly Yurchenko|Vitaly Yurchenko]] was used in a 1986 [[James Bond, Agent 007 (Semic comics)|Semic Press James Bond comic]] titled ''\"Death in Florence\"''.\n* [[a-ha|A-ha]]'s lead vocalist, [[Morten Harket]] was offered a small role as a villain's henchman in ''The Living Daylights'', but declined, because of lack of time and the reasoning that they wanted to cast him just because of his popularity, not his acting. Instead, [[a-ha]] sang the title song for ''The Living Daylights''.\n* In a cameo role, series composer [[John Barry]] conducts the orchestra in Vienna at the end of the film. Producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] also continues his string of Bond film cameo appearances; he can be seen as a member of the opera house audience.\n* The then-[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III Prince] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales Princess of Wales] visited the film's set during several occasions, with one particular moment being the members of the Royal Family tested one of the props, which was a fake glass bottle made out of sugar during a visit to the set of Brad Whitaker's Tangier mansion.\n* The use of the Russian phrase \"Smert Shpionam\" (\"Death to Spies\") is a reference to [[SMERSH]], the Russian spy agency James Bond combated in the early [[Ian Fleming]] novels. It was mentioned in only one previous Bond film, ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''.\n* ''The Living Daylights'' is the first Bond film since ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' to not have its title announced in the end credits of the previous film, nor has any Bond film since had its title announced in the end credits of the previous film.\n*It was the first film in 14 years to feature [[Felix Leiter]] who had not been seen since ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''.\n*The actors who portrayed Pushkin and Rubavitch have starred in science fiction television series after the film's release - John Rhys-Davies in ''Sliders'' and Virginia Hey in ''Farscape''. Both actors appeared in 1980s-era blockbuster film franchises (Rhys-Davies in the Indiana Jones series and Hey in Mad Max 2).\n*This film is noted for Virginia Hey appearing partially nude in a Bond film outside the opening credits (images of nudity have been used in a majority of the Maurice Binder designed title sequences).\n*This is the second time we see [[M]] in his Royal Navy uniform; the first time was in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' when he wore the Royal Navy whites with the old insignia board.\n*This was the last film of the series ever to be rated PG by the MPAA in North America. The following ones beginning with the next movie ''[[Licence to Kill (film)|License to Kill]]'' are rated PG-13.\n* ''The Living Daylights'' is the first Bond film without any actors who appeared in the original James Bond film [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']], following [[Lois Maxwell]]'s departure from the role of [[Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell)|Miss Moneypenny]].\n* This is the final appearance of M's original office before it is redesigned in ''GoldenEye''.\n* This is also the final appearance of the original Q Lab.\n* This is the final appearance of Sir [[Frederick Gray]].\n** This is also the final acting appearance of Geoffrey Keen 18 years before his death on November 3, 2005.\n* This is the only Dalton Bond film where Bond interacts with Miss Moneypenny and scenes in Q Lab.\n* This is also the only Dalton Bond film to feature Sir Frederick Gray and scenes in M's office.",

Instead, [[a-ha]] sang the title song for ''The Living Daylights''.\n* In a cameo role, series composer [[John Barry]] conducts the orchestra in Vienna at the end of the film. Producer [[Michael G. Wilson]] also continues his string of Bond film cameo appearances; he can be seen as a member of the opera house audience.\n* The then-[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III Prince] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales Princess of Wales] visited the film's set during several occasions, with one particular moment being the members of the Royal Family tested one of the props, which was a fake glass bottle made out of sugar during a visit to the set of Brad Whitaker's Tangier mansion.\n* The use of the Russian phrase \"Smert Shpionam\" (\"Death to Spies\") is a reference to [[SMERSH]], the Russian spy agency James Bond combated in the early [[Ian Fleming]] novels. It was mentioned in only one previous Bond film, ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''.\n* ''The Living Daylights'' is the first Bond film since ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' to not have its title announced in the end credits of the previous film, nor has any Bond film since had its title announced in the end credits of the previous film.\n*It was the first film in 14 years to feature [[Felix Leiter]] who had not been seen since ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''.\n*The actors who portrayed Pushkin and Rubavitch have starred in science fiction television series after the film's release - John Rhys-Davies in ''Sliders'' and Virginia Hey in ''Farscape''. Both actors appeared in 1980s-era blockbuster film franchises (Rhys-Davies in the Indiana Jones series and Hey in Mad Max 2).\n*This film is noted for Virginia Hey appearing partially nude in a Bond film outside the opening credits (images of nudity have been used in a majority of the Maurice Binder designed title sequences).\n*This is the second time we see [[M]] in his Royal Navy uniform; the first time was in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' when he wore the Royal Navy whites with the old insignia board.\n*This was the last film of the series ever to be rated PG by the MPAA in North America. The following ones beginning with the next movie ''[[Licence to Kill (film)|License to Kill]]'' are rated PG-13.\n* ''The Living Daylights'' is the first Bond film without any actors who appeared in the original James Bond film [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']], following [[Lois Maxwell]]'s departure from the role of [[Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell)|Miss Moneypenny]].\n* This is the final appearance of M's original office before it is redesigned in ''GoldenEye''.\n* This is also the final appearance of the original Q Lab.\n* This is the final appearance of Sir [[Frederick Gray]].\n** This is also the final acting appearance of Geoffrey Keen 18 years before his death on November 3, 2005.\n* This is the only Dalton Bond film where Bond interacts with Miss Moneypenny and scenes in Q Lab.\n* This is also the only Dalton Bond film to feature Sir Frederick Gray and scenes in M's office.",
