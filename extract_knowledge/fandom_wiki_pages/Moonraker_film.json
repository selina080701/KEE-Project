It it also the final film to have [[Bernard Lee]] as M two years before his death in 1981. This film was released in 1979. The film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Michael G. Wilson]].\n\nThe film owes very little to [[Moonraker (novel)|Ian Fleming's novel of the same name]], although it does feature its character [[Sir Hugo Drax]]. The screenplay was written by [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], who had previously co-written and novelised the screenplay for the previous film, ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me]]''; both ''Moonraker'' and ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' share the main plot element of a billionaire industrialist attempting to wipe out humanity and start a great reset of civilisation while sheltering in an isolated location. Wood also novelised ''Moonraker'' in 1979.\n\nThe title comes from \"moonraker\", a synonym for moonsail, the highest sail carried by sailing ships. It also refers to reaching for the moon, which runs parallels with the film's main aspect of travelling into space.\n\nDespite being the most commercially successful Bond film up to that point (only being eventually surpassed by [[GoldenEye (film)|''GoldenEye'']], 16 years later) reviews of Moonraker were mixed - with critics citing its outlandish and over-the-top plot which veered into space opera.",
    "Plot Summary": "{{More Images Needed}}\n===Africa===\nThe movie begins with a space shuttle being stolen while being transported on the top of an airliner. It blasts right off the aeroplane, incinerating the crew.\n\nBond is returning from [[South Africa]] on a different plane when [[Apollo Air Hostess|the hostess]] and [[Apollo Pilot|pilot]] betray him. He doesn't know it yet, but on the plane with him is the villain [[Jaws (Richard Kiel)|Jaws]], who had appeared in the last Bond film, ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''. The pilot shoots the planes controls intending for Bond to crash along with the plane after parachuting to safety. Bond wrestles with the pilot, eventually pushing him out of the airplane still wearing the parachute. Bond jumps after him and manages to strip the pilot of the parachute and puts it on. Jaws, having jumped out of the plane after Bond, attempts to remove Bonds parachute then bite him on the neck. Bond resists long enough to deploy his 'chute. Jaws parachute fails to deploy and he lands in the middle of a circus tent.\n\n===California===\nWhen he gets to [[London]], Bond is ordered to investigate Drax, who is a supplier of space shuttles to the US government in the film. Bond goes to see Drax at [[The Drax Estate|his ''château'']] in California, which has been shipped stone by stone from [[France]]. While there, Drax and Bond go hunting, and [[Tree Assassin|a man set up in a tree]] to kill Bond is shot by 007. At first Drax thinks Bond was shooting at the game bird and thinks he missed. Bond says 'look again, Mr. Drax' and it is seen that the man in the tree was shot. \n\nAt Drax's research facility Bond meets [[Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles)|Dr. Goodhead]] who sets him up in a machine which simulates G forces, although one of Drax's men tries to kill him by making it spin too fast.\n\n===Venice===\n[[File:Moonraker-14.jpg|thumb|Bond battling Chang in the Venetian clocktower.]]\nBond photographs some of the plans at Drax's lab with a miniature camera, which lead him to a glass manufacturer in [[Venice]], [[Italy]]. While there, he is attacked by Drax's henchman [[Chang]], and they proceed to smash up most of a glass display area before Bond ultimately throws him out the window of a clock tower, causing him to crash through a piano in the plaza below. There is also a chase through the canals, where Bond's [[Gondola Hovercraft|gondola]] has an engine, and even turns itself into a hovercraft, going across plazas in Venice. Bond also meets Dr. Goodhead in Venice, and discovers she is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent. Bond sneaks into Drax's research facility, discovering [[Nerve Gas|highly toxic gases]], and calls in [[M (Bernard Lee)|M]] from London, although when they go back to the research facility they are surprised to see that it has completely changed and Drax is there to meet them. However after the meeting, while the [[Fredrick Gray|Minister of Defense]] wants Bond taken off the assignment, Bond shows M one of the vials he swiped earlier confirming to him the laboratory was real, and M discreetly allows Bond to continue his investigation under the pretense of being on leave.\n\n===Brazil===\nBond is led to Rio de Janeiro where he meets Dr. Goodhead and Jaws again, and Bond battles it out with Jaws on top of a cable car high above the city, ending in Jaws' cable car crashing into the house at the end. Bond and Dr. Goodhead are captured by agents of Drax posing as ambulance drivers and taken away in an ambulance, where they are able to escape, knocking [[Ambulanceman|one of the men]] out the door and into a British Airways advertising sign.\n\nBond then travels up the Amazon river looking for Drax's research facility, which houses his fleet of [[Moonraker (Space Shuttle)|Moonraker]] shuttles, and has to deal with Jaws and some other of Drax's men following him. Bond's boat has a number of gadgets, including mines and torpedoes, and Bond drives over a waterfall and ejects with a hang-glider just in time, while Jaws's boat plummets below. \n\nAs Bond makes his way through the jungle, [[Blonde Beauty|a girl]] in the distance catches his eye and puts him in a trance. Bond follows a girl inside [[Amazonian Launch Complex|the temple]] and encounters [[Drax's Girls|other girls]]. Bond fails to notice that the rock he stands on tilts him into the pond, and along comes a reticulated python. Bond struggles to reach the edge of the pond but the snake catches him and tries to overpower him. Bond uses a hypodermic pen to kill the snake. \n\nAs Bond reaches the edge of the pond, Jaws stands in front of him and is captured again after killing the snake, which was Drax's pet, and, alongside Dr. Goodhead, is put in the bay of a space shuttle, which is about to launch so that the shuttle will incinerate them on take off. Fortunately Bond's watch has plastic explosive attached to it, and they manage to escape just in time, and posing as pilots, board one of Drax's shuttles into orbit.\n\n===Outer Space===\nDrax has converted a toxin found in [[Orchidae Nigra|a species of orchid]] found in the Amazon River basin, which in its natural state causes sterility, into a lethal nerve agent. He plans to destroy all human life (the toxin affects only humans) by launching a series of 50 globes containing the toxin from a [[Drax's Space Station|space station]]; the toxin would be dispersed when each globe broke up during reentry into [[Earth]]'s atmosphere. Before launching the globes, Drax transported several hundred carefully selected young men and women to the space station. They would live there until Earth was safe again for human life; these people would be the seed for a \"new master race\". Bond reaches the villain's orbital lair by means of the space shuttle. Holly Goodhead, is a CIA agent who competently wards off villains and pilots the space shuttle.\n\nThe space station managed to stay hidden from radar on earth due to a radar jamming device, which Bond and Goodhead must disable. After they do this, radar spots them from Earth and there is a brief phone conversation between the Americans and the Russian [[General Gogol]] before the Americans send marines on board a space shuttle for Drax's station. When they arrive, a battle with lasers ensues. At the end of the film, Jaws who had opposed Bond throughout, ends up going to his side when Bond points out that Jaws' [[Dolly|girlfriend]] would not live up to Drax's standards for human 'perfection'. Jaws also speaks for the first time, saying to his girlfriend, \"Well, here's to us.\" As they break open a champagne bottle on their way back to Earth. Bond and Goodhead leave on a space shuttle to destroy the three probes which are heading towards earth. Bond destroys the first two on automatic pilot and finally gets the last one on manual control. At the end of the film the Americans and British try to talk to Bond and Goodhead to congratulate them, but they are having sex under a sheet while in orbit. M rhetorically asks 'what does bond think he's doing' and [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]], who is looking at the radar screen, but not at the picture of the two of them says 'I think he's attempting re-entry sir'.",

    "Production": "[[File:Moonraker (Pan, 1961).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover of the 1961 Pan Books release of Moonraker. The movie deviates significantly from the original novel's plot.]]\nIn 1955, the film rights to ''Moonraker'' novel were initially sold to the Rank Organisation for £10,000. Fleming eventually bought back the rights in 1959, with the Rank Organisation ultimately never doing anything with it.\n\nIn the end credits of the previous Bond film ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me]],'' it says \"James Bond will return in ''[[For Your Eyes Only]]''\". However, after the tremendous box office success of [[w:c:starwars:Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'' (i.e. \"A New Hope\")]] and ''[[Wikipedia:Close Encounters of the Third Kind|Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' in 1977, the producers decided they wanted to cash in on the subsequent science fiction craze and make Moonraker instead, thus For Your Eyes Only was held back to become the next Bond film after Moonraker.\n\nThe title was taken from [[Ian Fleming]]'s third James Bond novel, [[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]. Though ultimately the plot of the film is broadly disassociated with the original novel, with only really the main villain's name kept and both involving rocket/missile technology (in the book, \"Moonraker\" was a [[Moonraker Rocket|tactical ballistic missile]] and the movie, its a [[Moonraker (Space Shuttle)|series of Space Shuttles]]). Instead, the film is closer to the prior ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' in plot construction, seeing the return of Jaws as a major henchman. If anything, most of the aspects of the original book would later be utilized in 1995's ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]'' and 2002's ''[[Die Another Day (film)|Die Another Day]]'' -- both starring [[Pierce Brosnan]] as James Bond.\n\n===Script===\n[[Tom Mankiewicz]] had written a screenplay of ''Moonraker'' that was eventually discarded. Some scenes from his script were later used in subsequent films, including the [[Bede BD-5J|Acrostar Jet]] sequence used in the teaser for ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'', and the Eiffel Tower scene in ''[[A View to a Kill]]''. Also, Nepal and India were considered for filming locations - the latter of which was used in Octopussy.\n\n===Cast===\n[[Lois Chiles]] had been first approached by the producers for the role of [[Anya Amasova]] in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' but had turned down the role as she had planned to leave the acting profession at that time. She later shared an airline seat with director Lewis Gilbert during her brief retirement where she ended up in the film.\n\nBernard Lee makes his final appearance as 'M'. The actor was in ill health at the time of filming. Although he was scheduled to appear in the next Bond film, he died during pre-production.\n\n===Location scouting===\nCubby Broccoli took a holiday in Brazil where he visited Iguacu Falls - the location used in the film for the boat chase (the actual boat chase was filmed outside Jupiter, Florida doubling for the Amazon).\n\n===Product placement===\nDrax's vehicle fleet seen at his French chateau (the real life Vaux-Le-Vicomte) consisted of American Motors and Jeep vehicles (from an AMC Concord, Jeep CJ-7, Jeep J10 light truck, and a Jeep Cherokee) - at the time of the film's release, American Motors and Jeep products were distributed in Europe by Renault since March 1978 (the French automaker previously collaborated with AMC during the mid-1960s when Renault assembled Ramblers in Europe and its Argentine subsidiary produced a version of the Rambler American as the IKA (later Renault) Torino. \n\nRenault would become the owner of AMC in the early 1980s until 1987 when financial affairs in France would lead to a divestment when its shares of AMC were sold to the Chrysler Corporation - Jeep (which became part of AMC back in 1970 after its previous owners Willys-Overland and Kaiser owned the brand) became a Chrysler division with Chrysler, Dodge, and Ram. AMC previously had a product placement in [[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|''The Man with the Golden Gun'']].\n\n===Effects===\nThe title sequence is dominated by the recurring image of the moon, with silhouettes of women floating weightlessly across the screen. Maurice Binder achieved this effect by having the women jump on a trampoline during filming. According to [[Albert R. Broccoli]], the title sequence for this film alone cost more to produce than the entire first feature film in the series, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.",

    "Reception and legacy": "Moonraker remains one of the better known James Bond movies, yet it bears a complicated legacy. Its a divisive film, with some considering it the low point in the Bond franchise for its over-the-top sci-fi elements, while others appreciate it for its spectacle and camp value. While not universally loved, Moonraker has secured a unique place in the Bond canon, especially for fans who appreciate its unashamed embrace of late-'70s sci-fi and spectacle.\n\nIt got mixed-to-negative reception from the film critics when it was first released. A lot of them thought the movie focused too much on action and visual effects rather than the spy elements. The space setting was seen as gimmick trying to ride the success of Star Wars. Some pointed out the film had too many gadgets, and the tone became more/too silly and funny. The story was considered mostly perfunctory, with some deeming it wasn’t as strong as in earlier Bond films. [[Roger Moore]]'s acting was mostly considered aptly charming, though some felt that he was starting to look too much like a comic-book character.\n\nFinancially, the film was a big box office success when it was first released. Earning over $210 million globally, it made Moonraker the highest-grossing Bond film up to that point in franchise's history (even though its higher budget decreased the true profit margin). Its believed that Moonraker helped ensure that the franchise stayed financially successful.\n\n===Effect on Bond franchise===\n[[File:Aztec Goldeneye 007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Screenshot of the \"Aztec\" bonus mission in ''GoldenEye 007'', which is a tribute to the 1979 movie.]]\nEffectively, Moonraker is a film that pushed Bond to his limits (literally into space) and helped define the boundaries of what the movie audiences and series fans wanted from the 007 franchise. EON would address criticism pointed towards the film, with the next film - 1981's ''[[For Your Eyes Only]]'' - serving as kind of course correction and returning Bond to a more grounded and serious tone.\n\nAlthough mostly ignored within EON's own film canon - with exception to few nods in ''[[Die Another Day]]'' - Moonraker is more acknowledged in the extended James Bond franchise. One of the better known tributes being the [[List_of_Levels_of_GoldenEye_007_(1997)#Aztec|\"Aztec\"]] bonus mission in the famous [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 game)|GoldenEye 007]], which is based on the Aztec Launch Complex from the movie.\n\nAdditionally, the plot of the videogame [[James Bond 007: NightFire]] appears to use the 1979 Moonraker movie as the template for its plot. Like in the Moonraker movie, James Bond goes to outer space in NightFire.\n\n===Staff opinion===\n[[Roger Moore]] saw Moonraker as fun but far-fetched. He was self-aware and good-humored about its excesses, even if he thought it strayed a bit too far from classic Bond. Moore would famously compare the 2002 Bond movie ''[[Die Another Day (film)|Die Another Day]]'' with ''Moonraker'' unfavorably, by saying that the former “went too far” even for “the first Bond in space”.\n\nScreenwriter [[Christopher Wood]] would later profess that he bears the blame for turning the film too jokey and without serious stakes. Though he also deemed that the outdated nature of the original Moonraker novel was not helpful in writing. Ultimately, what he cherished the most was being able to work with Lewis Gilbert.\n\n[[Albert R. Broccoli]] deemed that capitalizing on the science‑fiction boom triggered by ''Star Wars'' was a sound decision, but was displeased with the budget ballooning during the filming, stating that “I once made entire movies for less than the phone bills on this one.”\n\n[[Richard Maibaum]] commented and criticized: \"With ''Moonraker'', we went too far in the outlandish. The audience did not believe any more and Roger spoofed too much. Thank God I didn’t write that one.” ''Moonraker'' was the third and final Bond screenplay that Maibaum didn't write or cowrite, in his lifetime. The other two being ''You Only Live Twice'' and ''Live and Let Die.''\n\n===Influence===\nThe film inspires part of the plot of ''[[Wikipedia:Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]''.\n\nIn a scene in the ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' episode [[w:c:buffy:Life Serial|Life Serial]] when the Nerd Trio are arguing over who the better James Bond actor is, Warren expresses dislike for Moonraker twice because of the gondola scene, calling it \"inexcusable\".",
