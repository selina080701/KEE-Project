    "Plot": "A young [[Madeleine Swann]] witnesses the murder of her mother by the terrorist [[Safin|Lyutsifer Safin]] whom she shoots in retribution. Swann flees onto a nearby [[frozen lake]] after he awakens and she falls through the ice. Safin chooses to save her.\n\nIn the present, Swann is in [[Matera]], [[Italy]] with [[James Bond (Daniel Craig)|James Bond]] following the capture of [[Blofeld (Christoph Waltz)|Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]. After some persuasion, Bond visits [[Vesper Lynd (Eva Green)|Vesper Lynd's]] tomb to seek forgiveness and finally bring closure to her death. The tomb is blown up and Bond is ambushed by [[SPECTRE]] assassins, including [[Primo]]. Bond accuses Swann of betraying him to the organisation and leaves her on a train telling her they will never see each other again.\n\nFive years later, [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] scientist [[Valdo Obruchev]] is kidnapped from an MI6 laboratory. Obruchev has developed [[Project Heracles]], a bioweapon containing nanobots that spread like a virus upon touch. Coded to specific DNA strands, they are only dangerous if programmed to an individual's genetic code. Bond has retired to [[Port Antonio, Jamaica]] where, after years of being out of service, he is contacted by the CIA agent [[Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright)|Felix Leiter]], who is accompanied by [[Logan Ash]], a fellow American agent. They ask for help in tracking down Obruchev, but Bond refuses. That night Bond is tracked down by a woman named [[Nomi]], who has succeeded him as the new 007; she tells him about Project Heracles. Bond contacts [[M (Ralph Fiennes)|M]] and reproaches him; the nanobot project had been commissioned by M. Bond subsequently accepts Leiter's request for help.\n\nBond, Leiter, and Ash fly to Cuba and meet [[Paloma]], another CIA agent allied with Leiter. Bond and Paloma infiltrate a SPECTRE meeting with the aim of retrieving Obruchev, but instead, they walk into a trap. Using a [[Blofeld's Eye|Bionic Eye]] to see and communicate while still in custody, Blofeld orders Bond to be killed by the nanobots. Instead, all of the SPECTRE members are killed as Obruchev had reprogrammed the nanobots to destroy the organization per Safin's orders, something which both Bond and Blofeld didn't expect. Bond extracts Obruchev to a boat to meet with Felix and Ash, who turns against them as he is in league with Safin. Ash shoots Leiter and destroys the boat before escaping with Obruchev (via plane that Ash stole from Bond). Bond gets away to safety, but Leiter dies from his injuries.\n\n[[Miss Moneypenny (Naomie Harris)|Miss Moneypenny]] takes Bond to see [[Q (Ben Whishaw)|Q]] and gain him the opportunity to meet and speak with Blofeld to find out where Obruchev has been taken with the nanobots. However, Safin visits Madeleine and blackmails her into infecting herself with the nanobots. As Madeleine has been the only person in contact with Blofeld since his imprisonment, he instructs her to infect Blofeld. Bond encounters Madeline in the cell, where he touches her on the hand and unknowingly infects himself. A horrified Madeleine leaves the cell. When Bond meets Blofeld, the latter reveals that he deliberately staged the ambush in Matera five years earlier to make it look as if Madeline had betrayed him. Angered by this revelation, Bond attacks Blofeld and unknowingly infects him with the nanobots, killing Blofeld just as Safin planned.\n\nUpon realizing what happened, Bond tracks Madeleine down to her childhood home in Norway. There, he learns that Madeleine has a five-year-old daughter, [[Mathilde Swann]], whom she claims is not his. Madeleine then confesses to Bond that the Safin family is from Kazan. Lyutsifer's father was named Gostan and was a rich pharmaceutical entrepreneur. Lyutsifer inherited his empire after his death. And Mr. White poisoned the Safin family and he scarred Lyutsifer’s face and sparing his life and he allowed SPECTRE to take control of \"The Poison Garden\", Safin continues his plan for revenge as he, Ash, and their men are on their way to capture Bond, Madeleine, and Mathilde. Though Bond manages to kill Ash and Safin's men, Safin successfully captures Madeleine and Mathilde.\n\nQ, Bond, and Nomi locate Safin on a World War II base on an [[The Poison Garden|island]] between Japan and Russia. They use a plane to infiltrate Safin's headquarters and learn that he plans to use the nanobots as a biological weapon to kill millions of people on the planet so that Safin can take over the world. Nomi takes Obruchev hostage while Bond searches for Safin, who has Mathilde with him as its hostage. Bond shoots Safin's guards, but Safin escapes. Mathilde escapes from Safin and reunites with her mother, Bond, and Nomi.\n\nNomi, Madeleine, and Mathilde escape by boat, while Bond stays behind to open the island's missile silos, which would aid a missile strike from the British warship HMS ''Dragon'' to destroy the nanobots. Bond and Safin fight, during which Safin shoots Bond several times and infects him with nanobots programmed with the genetic code of Madeleine and Mathilde. Bond kills Safin and opens the silos. Speaking by radio with Madeleine, Bond tells her he loves her and encourages her to move on without him, and she confirms that Mathilde is his daughter. Bond smiles in the realisation Mathilde is his daughter. He dies as the missiles hit the island, destroying the nanobot factory and the virus.\n\nAt MI6, M, Moneypenny, Q, [[Bill Tanner (Rory Kinnear)|Tanner]], and Nomi drink in Bond's honour. Elsewhere, Madeleine takes Mathilde to Matera and tells her the truth about her father.",

    " Trivia ": "* With a running time of 163 minutes, it is the longest film in the Bond series.\n* It is the first and only Daniel Craig Bond film to not be co-distributed with Sony Pictures Releasing under their [[Columbia Pictures]] label.\n* This is the fourth film to use the word \"die\" in its title, with the other three being [[Die Another Day (film)|''Die Another Day'']], ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies (film)|Tomorrow Never Dies]] and [[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''.\n* The song used during the closing credits is \"[[We Have All The Time In The World]]\" as performed by [[Louis Armstrong]]. This song was originally used as a secondary theme for the film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''. The use of the song in the film reflects a conversation had by James Bond and Madeleine Swann when they are out on a drive together. Swann asks Bond to go faster, but Bond tells her that they don't need to, that they have all the time in the world. Later, at the end of the film, Bond tells Swann that she has all the time in the world. ''No Time to Die'' parallels aspects of the OHMSS film by invoking the song following the death of a major character. Discounting the ''[[James Bond Theme]]'' and the \"secondary\" theme ''007'', it is the only original-to-Bond song to be featured in more than one film, and the first [[John Barry]] composition to appear in a Bond film since 1989.\n*When Bond and M are talking to each other at the London Bridge the main theme of the film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' can be heard in the background.\n*In similar fashion to the events of the film ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', Bond visits the grave of his former 'true love' only to then be surprised by an assassination attempt by Blofeld. In both films, Bond also ends up killing Blofeld, albeit unintentionally in this film's case.\n*It is the first and the only so far James Bond film in which:\n**Bond is killed.\n**Felix Leiter is killed.\n**Blofeld is killed (unless the unnamed bald man in the opening scene of [[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]] counts).\n**Bond becomes a father.\n**The OO7 code number was used by someone else than Bond.\n**A 00 agent other than James Bond is featured in a major role (rather than as a background character or briefly as part of setting up the plot of the film).\n* This is the first film since ''[[The World Is Not Enough (film)|The World Is Not Enough]]'' to show a 00-section agent other than Bond and the first to assign the agent a name ([[Nomi]]) since [[Bill Fairbanks]] was mentioned in ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''.\n* The film does not reveal what 00 number Bond is assigned after he is reinstated. Likewise, the film does not indicate what number Nomi receives, whether she is given back 007 after the mission or assigned a new number.\n* Nomi's surname is never revealed, nor so we learn Paloma's surname (assuming it's not Paloma).\n* Although not acknowledged explicitly, this film adapts elements of the novels ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'' and ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', with M quoting directly from ''Twice'' at the end of the film, Bond demanding Blofeld die, and the concept of Bond leaving the 00's and attaining a special status coming from that book (and, as in the books, Bond eventually regains the 007 designation). Media reports during production indicated that a working title for the movie was ''Shatterhand'', the alias used by Blofeld in ''You Only Live Twice.'' The parallels to OHMSS include the death of a major character (Bond in this case, rather than the female lead) and the invoking of the phrase \"We have all the time in the world,\" along with the reuse of music from the 1969 film.",
