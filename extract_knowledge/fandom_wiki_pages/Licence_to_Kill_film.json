Released in the [[United Kingdom]] on 13 June, [[007 franchise timeline#1989|1989]], ''Licence to Kill'' is the fifth and last Bond film to be directed by [[John Glen]], and the second and final film with [[Timothy Dalton]] portraying [[United Kingdom|British]] Secret Service agent, Commander [[James Bond (Timothy Dalton)|James Bond]]. It is also the final film to have [[Robert Brown]] as [[M (Robert Brown)|M]] and [[Caroline Bliss]] as [[Miss Moneypenny (Caroline Bliss)|Miss Moneypenny]] as well as the final film to have both the Gunbarrel sequence and the main title sequence designed by [[Maurice Binder]] before his death in 1991 and the final film to be produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]], who was unavailable for [[007 franchise timeline#1995|1995]]'s ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]'' due to his declining health. Broccoli had been credited with producing every EON James Bond film since ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), with the exception of ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).\n\nThis was actually the first EON Productions entry to use a title not derived from either a novel or a short story by [[Ian Fleming]]. However, it does contain elements and characters from Fleming's novel, ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'', and the short story, \"[[For Your Eyes Only#\"The Hildebrand Rarity\"|The Hildebrand Rarity]]\" (from the collection ''[[For Your Eyes Only (book)|For Your Eyes Only]]''). This would be the last James Bond film to make direct use of Ian Fleming's concepts and characters until ''[[Die Another Day (film)|Die Another Day]]'' (2002).",
    "Plot Summary": "===Capture of Sanchez===\n[[File:FelixSharkeyBond-OnWayToWedding.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|James Bond - the best man in the renewal wedding - showing the wedding ring to Leiter.]]\nThe story opens with the [[United States Coast Guard]] AWACS-plane confirming the arrival of South American drug lord [[Franz Sanchez]] to Cray Cay in Havana. As Sanchez is now within United States jurisdiction, they inform the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) unit at Key West, Florida, in hopes that if they act fast, they could \"grab the bastard.\"\n\n[[James Bond (Timothy Dalton)|James Bond]], his American friend, [[Felix Leiter (David Hedison)|Felix Leiter]] (working a joint task force between the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]) and their local friend [[Sharkey]] are on their way to Leiter's vow renewal on a Rolls-Royce, driving on the Overseas Highway. As Leiter if Bond - the best man - still has the wedding ring ready, a Coast Guard [[Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin|HH-65 helicopter]] appears, signaling Leiter to pull over. Finding a good spot, the helicopter lands, with DEA agents [[Hawkins]] and [[Mullens]] getting out and telling Leiter that Sanchez is in the Bahamas. Leiter grabs on to this vital moment, with Bond accompanying him to operation, while the two leave Sharkey to go explain Felix's wife, [[Della]] about the delay.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Sanchez Cartel]] gangsters stake out a hiding house in the Cray Key, killing the guards there. Sanchez finds his mistress - [[Lupe Lamora]] - in bed with [[Alvarez|another man]]; and in retaliation for her infidelity, he has his henchman [[Dario]] cut out the man's heart while he brutally whips his mistress. \n\n[[File:007 Mid-Air-Hiest LANDSCAPE.webp|thumb|right|250px|James Bond rappelling from a helicopter to try hook up Sanchez's escape plane.]]\nBond, Felix and the DEA agents reach the Cray Key hideout and quickly get in a fire fight with Sanchez's men. After having seemingly repelled Sanchez's henchmen, Bond spots Lupe, who promptly leaves. \n\nFelix and others then hear some noise, as during the firefight, Sanchez has managed to sneak aboard a [[Cessna 172|small Cessna plane]] and attempts to escape, potentially once more eluding the DEA's grasp. Bond and co. pursue in the USCG helicopter, and with Bond managing to lock a hook-on Sanchez's plane, they finally capture the ever-elusive drug baron. Afterwards, Bond and Leiter parachute down to the church and the ceremony begins.\n\n===Wedding party===\nSanchez is escorted to a Coast Guard interrogation block in Florida, where is being hounded by DEA Agent [[Ed Killifer]], who apparently takes offense at Sanchez's nonchalant attempt to bribe other law enforcement officials with two million US dollars. Meanwhile, a big party is going on at Felix Leiter's home. Leiter is at this home office and Della asks Bond to go ask him to stop working and join the guests. \n\nAt the room, Bond catches a glimpse of a mysterious woman (later revealed to be [[Pam Bouvier]]) who swiftly leaves, with Leiter busy filing a report about Sanchez's capture and tells how difficult it has been to try achieve it. They are then joined by Killifer, who tells them that he's going to accompany the convoy escorting Sanchez to Quantico, Virginia. Killifer leaves, with Bond present to see Leiter hide a disc (containing info regarding investigations on Sanchez) behind a framed picture. The party continues, with Leiter gifting Bond a [[Leiter Lighter]] with an oversized flame jet. \n\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK Van Dive.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kilifer driving the armored van carrying Sanchez off the Overseas Highway bridge.]]\nMeanwhile, the Floridian police convoy begins escorting Sanchez in a armored van along the Overseas Highway (US Route 1). Killifer is with the front seats of the armored van, and the convoy reaches \"Bridge Under Repair\" sign, it prompts Killifer to use the butt of his shotgun to knock out the driver and takes control of the armored van. He careens the armored van off the bridge and into the water, and as the van sinks, scuba divers appear and they rescue Sanchez and Killifer, taking the two aboard a [[Shark Hunter II Submersible|small submersible]].\n\nLater in the evening, Felix and Della are offering farewells to departing Bond, with Della throwing her wedding garter to Bond. Bond gives a sad smile to hide his pained memories, with Felix telling Della that Bond too [[Tracy Bond (Diana Rigg)|was once married]], which ended in tragedy. As Felix and Della head inside, they are ambushed at their bedroom and captured by Sanchez's enforcer [[Dario]] and several of Sanchez's henchmen.\n\n===The mauling===\nBlindfolded Leiter is taken to [[Ocean Exotica Warehouse]], operated by marine researcher [[Milton Krest]], who is one of Sanchez's drug smugglers. At his office booth, Krest talks with Sanchez, with the former being antsy about how latter conducts his business. Sanchez says that he will wait for Dario and that he is going to reward Killifer, because to him, loyalty is more important than money. Sanchez asks Killifer to the office and gives him a heavy suitcase containing the 2 million dollars of bribe money. Then Dario comes and Sanchez goes to see Leiter, after warning Krest to not fool around with Lupe.\n\n[[File:Ocean Exotica warehouse 2.png|thumb|right|300px|Leiter confronted by Sanchez and his men at the Ocean Exotica Warehouse.]]\nLeiter is brought to the middle of the warehouse, with Dario removing his blinds and Sanchez appears in front of him. As Leiter asks what has happened to his wife, Dario darkly quips that he and Sanchez's men gave her \"a nice honeymoon.\" Leiter becomes engraged and Sanchez drily informs that, what he is about to do, he is not doing out of personal reasons, but for business reason. Sanchez makes his men open the [[Shark Tank]] and Killifer appears, with Leiter realizing he has betrayed DEA.\n\nLeiter is attached to a hook and Sanchez's men throw a large meat slab of a slaughtered animal into the shark tank. As the sharks eat the meat, Leiter is gradually lowered down. As Leiter curses Sanchez, the latter informs him that he plans to have Felix to be maimed by the sharks, but not to die. The sharks tear into Leiter, with the reactions of Sanchez's collaborators divided between twisted amusement and nauseation over the gory display.\n\nThe next morning, Bond arrives to the [[Key West International Airport]] in a [[Lincoln Mark VII LSC]]. While Bond is having his ticket checked for his flight at the reception, he hears about some commotion and inquires it. The clerk tells that \"some big drug dealer\" has escaped and - realizing the implications - Bond bolts out of the airport.\n\n[[File:Ltk bond finds felix.webp|thumb|left|250px|Bond finds maimed Felix at latter's home.]]\nBond arrives back to Leiter's home and investigates the quiet house. Soon enough, Bond finds Della in her wedding dress, dead. In the study - which has been thoroughly ransacked by Sanchez's thugs - Bond finds Felix, maimed but still alive, bearing a note from Sanchez: \"He disagreed with something that ate him.\" Bond becomes outraged about this, but hears phone ringing and answers, demanding the caller to get an ambulance.\n\nLocal police arrive to investigate Leiter's house, while he is taken to a hospital and a detective will give Bond questions about the murder. Bond is soon joined by Sharkey, with the police - lead by [[Rasmussen]] - thinking that Leiter's wounds are result of a chainsaw used by Columbian gangsters. Bond and Sharkey then see Leiter at hospital, where Sharkey deems that Leiter's wounds are definitely a result from a shark bite. DEA agent [[Hawkins]], who was with Bond when they captured Sanchez the first time, comes to see Leiter and tells that the trail on Sanchez has gone cold. Bond becomes upset about the local law enforcement's unwillingness to do anything and decides to take matters into his own hands.\n\n===Investigation of Ocean Exotica===\nBond and Sharkey go around Key West to try find a place that would have the sharks that Sanchez used to maim Leiter. After having searched some off-screen, they arrive at the Ocean Exotica Warehouse as the last possible location. Krest orders Killifer to stay hidden, as a [[Bill|guard named Bill]] answers and tries to shoo away Bond. But when Bond presents himself as a international sealife trader from London, Krest deems to allow Bond in. \n\nKrest half-heartedly tours Bond around the warehouse and explains that he no longer has sharks, but conducts research on genetically modified fish. After Bond inquires about the submersible, which Krest explains is for sale, he appears come to a dead end. That is until he spots one of Della's wedding garters amongst swept up dirt and Bond tries to graciously leave without raising Krest's suspicions further.\n\nCome night-time, Bond and Sharkey attempt to infiltrate the warehouse to find clues regarding its involvement with Sanchez. As they are infiltrating by the pier connecting to the warehouse, they see the small submersible leaving. Bond gets access under the the warehouse and begins searching the place. Bond eventually checks a drawer full of wriggling maggots - meant as nutrition for the genetically modified fish - and sticks his hands in it, finding bags of cocaine. \n\nAs his hands are still there, Bill catches Bond at gunpoint and tries to detain him. As Bond requests that he is allowed to atleast get his hands out of the bed of maggots, he uses it as chance to grab a fistful of them and throws them at Bill, staggering him. Bond then knocks out Bill and throws him on the bed of maggots and slams the drawer close, quipping \"bon appétit.\" As he does so, the second guard opens fire on Bond with an [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5 submachinegun]]. Bond dodges the gunfire, which breaks the equipment and aquarium full of fish. As the guard loses sight on Bond, he walks down the stairs to try find him, only for Bond to use a hook and pull him into a aquarium containing an electric eel, which electrocutes the guard to death.\n\n[[File:BONDWIKI LTK Bond Sharkey Killifer Photo1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|James Bond about to punish Killifer for his corruption.]]\nBond gets out of hiding, only to be immediately get ambushed by Killifer - carrying a revolver and the bribe money suitcase - who orders Bond to freeze. With his gun drawn, Killifer orders Bond over the trap door, with Bond correctly deducing that it has the sharks that maimed Felix. Killifer walks on the other trap door - that Bond entered through from the pier - and toggles the doors for the shark tank. As Killifer cocks his gun, Sharkey gets through the pier trap door, which knocks the former off balance and giving Bond the opportunity to overpower Killifer.\n\nBond punches Killifer, who backpedals on some chains over the shark tank. Precariously balancing on the edge in order to not fall in, Killifer begans bargaining with Bond, offering to split the 2 million dollars of bribe money. Silently wrathful Bond grabs the suitcase and throws it at Killifer, with the corrupt DEA agents falling into the shark tank and getting swiftly torn apart by the sharks. Seeing the open suitcase and money in the water, Sharkey deems it a terrible waste... of money.\n\n===Licence to Kill is revoked===\nThe next morning, Bond and Sharkey are aboard the latter's fishing boat, [[Pa-Ja-Ma]], going over the next phase of the investigation involving Krest's seavessel, the [[Wavekrest]]. However, as Bond is taking a stroll at streets of Key West, he is approached by Hawkins. Hawkins informs that local authorities are inspecting the Ocean Exotica Warehouse and that he doesn't approve of Bond's vigilantism. Bond tries to ethicize with Hawkins regarding the injustice done to Leiter, but the latter informs the former that he is taken to see someone.\n\n[[File:JamesBond (TimothyDalton).png|thumb|left|300px|James Bond being confronted by M at the Ernest Hemingway House.]]\nBond is escorted to the [[Ernest Hemingway House]], where Bond is confronted by an irate and disappointed [[M (Robert Brown)|M]], who inquires him about his failing to head to [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] for his next assignment and orders him to be on a plane this afternoon as he has a job to do. Bond explains he hasn't finished his revenge yet, but M tells Bond to let the Americans handle it. Bond implores that he owes it to Leiter to take down Sanchez and his cartel. But M rejects Bond's rationalizations and orders to drop the pursuit or it may compromise Her Majesty's government and orders Bond to do the assignment objectively and professionally. Refusing to let the matter go, Bond declares his resignation, with M sternly telling Bond that he will not be kicked out, but he is grounded for insubordination and thusly his [[licence to kill]] is revoked for the time being. Bond then disobeys M's orders and escapes MI6 custody, becoming a rogue agent bereft of MI6's backing. M is shocked to see that Bond has escaped and remarks, \"God help you, commander!\".\n\n===Wavekrest===\nThe scene changes to Wavekrest, where Lupe is at her cabin. Drunken Krest comes in, blaming her for the loss of Ocean Exotica warehouse to Key West authorities and warning that Sanchez may punish her for it. One of Krest's crew comes in and tells that they have something peculiar on radar, and upon reaching the ships bridge and observing the camera footage, he dismisses it as a manta ray. Unbeknownst to bridge crew, the manta ray is actually a decoy used by Bond for him to get close and grab onto one of the tows going inside Wavekrest.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK BondLupeKrest Wavekrest.jpg|thumb|right|300px|James Bond making Lupe to answer to Krest.]]\nBond succeeds in getting in and knocks out a guard, hiding him inside a vaulted chamber where he sees stacks of money wrapped in blue plastic. Bond sneaks around, but while doing so, another guard finds the guard that Bond knocked out. Bond finds Lupe's cabin and surprises her at knifepoint, ordering her to stay silent. Krest comes knocking and Bond makes Lupe answer, successfully convincing that Bond is not there. Bond then observes Lupe's bruises and she tries to justify them. Bond keeps talking to Lupe until something starts to happen outside.\n\nBond looks through the blinders and sees the Pa-Ja-Ma coming closer. He spots dead Sharkey hoisted on it, with a frogman named [[Clive]], who apparently killed Sharkey, making fun of his death. This enrages Bond and Lupe criticizes his mindset, with Bond clapping back before storming out of the cabin. Bond reaches the deck, complete out in the open, and grabs a [[speargun]]. As Clive climbs out of the water, Bond points the speargun and fires a harpoon right into Clive's stomach.\n\nThis alarms Krest and his men begin firing at Bond. Bond dives into the water with a oxygen tank, but Krest orders the frogmen under him to go dive after him. Meanwhile, a [[Cessna A185F|Skywagon seaplane]] arrives to the location, to transport the drug money. Bond finds one of the tows going into Wavekrest and destroys the cocaine it carries with his knife.\n\nBond rises from the water - which is now bleached white from the cocaine - only to attract a boat full of Krest's men to attack him. The frogmen find Bond hand he fights them, stealing one of the spearguns which he uses to grapple onto the pontoons of the seaplane. The seaplane begins to take off, with it pulling Bond onto the surface and making him essentially waterski without the skis. The seaplane keeps pulling Bond as Krest's men on the boat try to shoot Bond.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK Bond holdon seaplane.jpg|thumb|left|300px|James Bond holding onto the seaplane taking off.]]\nBond eventually maneuvers himself to latch on the seaplane's pontoons, just as the seaplane finally gets off the water. Bond climbs over the seaplane and as one of the drug dealers tries to over if he can find him, Bond gets inside and pulls the emergency door release lock to send the other drug dealer flying out. But the pilot knocks Bond into the back seats, with him drawing his revolver and trying to shoot Bond. \n\nBond uses the money bags to absorb the bullets and then uses it to hammer the pilot, who rocks the plane that almost causes Bond to fall off. Bond manages to kick the pilot unconscious and takes over the plane, eventually dropping the pilot out in the eyesight of Krest and others. Bond then leaves the scene in a streak of dollar bills flying out of the seaplane, and with immense amounts of money to finance his quest of vengeance against Sanchez.\n\n===Barrelhead Bar===\nAfter getting back on mainland, Bond heads back to Leiter's home, sneaking past police barricade tapes. Remembering the CD that Leiter hid behind the framed picture, Bond finds it and inserts it in Leiter's computer. Accessing the data on the CD, Bond finds a list of informants, with all having been killed except for one \"P. Bouvier\", whom Leiter was originally scheduled to meet \"thursday, after midnight\" at the [[Barrelhead Bar]] at Bimini. Off-screen, Bond acquires a [[Cigarette Racing Café Racer]] motorboat and heads to the Barrelhead Bar.\n[[File:BONDWIKI LTK BAR PHOTO1.png|thumb|250px|right|Bond and Pam are joined by Dario at the Barrelhead Bar.]]\nBond arrives at a pier by the bar and heads in. Bond quickly finds the contact - [[Pam Bouvier]] - sitting alone by a table and has a quick talk with her. She then spots Dario coming in, with other of Sanchez's heavies coming in from an another exit. Pam inquires if Bond has a gun and shows her his shoulder holster [[PPK]], that Pam is not too impressed by. She gives Bond a glimpse of her [[Mossberg 500 Cruiser|pump-action shotgun]] under the table and instructs Bond what to do. \n\nDario and one of his men seat by Bond and Pam's table, with Dario telling what he knows as Pam's background in flying charter planes for the Nicaraguan Contras. Dario wants to take Pam outside, but Bond barks at Dario to keep his hands off her and as Dario dismisses Bond, Pam then shoves her shotgun at Dario's crotch. When the waitress brings the beverages, Dario's companion tries to attack Bond, whom he subdues. Pam asks if Bond has a getaway vehicle and he confirms that he has a boat behind the wall they are sitting at.\n\nDario tries to pull a fast one and Pam fires the shotgun, missing him. Bar fight ensues with Bond and Pam fighting off Dario and his men being obstructed by panicked customers at the bar. After brawling and viying for position to escape, Bond and Pam are finally able to explode a hole in a wall with Pam's shotgun. Pam orders Bond to get the boat ready while she keeps Dario's men in check. Bond gets the boat running and Pam leaves through the hole in a wall, and as she jumps on the motorboat, Dario shoots at her back with a revolver.\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK Bond Pam Boatlove1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bond and Pam on a boat.]]\nBond use his PPK to scare Dario off and tries to drive away. A henchman with a submachine shoots at the boat's engine, with Bond retaliating by shooting him dead. Having gotten out of Dario's reach, Pam starts to make pained noises. Bond tries to come to her aid, but she doesn't really need to, since she was wearing a [[Bulletproof Vest|kelvar ballistic vest]]. After a brief argument regarding professionalism and trying to take on Sanchez all by themselves, Pam relents and agrees to help Bond.\n\nMeanwhile in England - at the MI6 headquarters - [[Miss Moneypenny (Caroline Bliss)|Miss Moneypenny]] is distraught by Bond's rogue status and Bond has gone missing, due to his resignation from MI6. M informs Moneypenny that he is aware that Bond is going after Sanchez and that the MI6 agents in the area have already been alerted to his arrival. M heads into his office, with Moneypenny then contacting the [[Q-branch]], with intent to inquire help for Bond.\n\n===Arrival to Isthmus===\nSubsequently, Bond and Pam arrive to [[Republic of Isthmus]], which is ostensibly run by \"El Presidente\" [[Hector Lopez]], but is effectively a narcostate that's shadow governed by Sanchez and his cartel. They first make shop at [[Hotel Mary Tierra]], where they discuss about their cover identities, giving money to Pam to get a do-over so that she looks like Bond's secretary.\n\nBond then takes the money he stole from the seaplane that visited Wavekrest and brings it to [[Banco de Isthmus]] to open an account and make a deposit. He visits a [[Montelongo|bank manager]], who is initially dismissive of Bond, but immediately changes tone when he brings his luggage full of money. All the while, Sanchez is visiting the bank with his accountant/financial advisor - [[Truman-Lodge]] - touring investors (including [[Kwang]]) around the bank. While Bond is negotiating with the bank manager, Pam returns to Bond, with a glossed-up look.\n\nLater that day, we see Sanchez is at his office atop [[Casino de Isthmus]], where he and Truman-Lodge are is observing a TV broadcast by televangelist [[Joe Butcher]]. Sanchez's cartel uses Butcher's broadcast as means of communicating with their clients and setting pricing for their cocaine sales. Sanchez then has a short talk with Lupe regarding what happened at Wavekrest.\n\n[[File:Dalton blackjack.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bond and Pam at Casino de Isthmus.]]\nBond and Pam visit the Casino de Isthmus's main gambling lobby, with the former starting to gamble with high bets to attract Sanchez's attention. Sanchez sends Lupe to check on Bond and as she deals cards, she informs Bond's about the danger he is in, if he pursues further. Regardless, Bond makes her to take him to Sanchez, while Pam was pre-occupied with ordering a drink to Bond.\n\nAfter Bond is searched for weapons - with Sanchez's thugs finding Bond's PPK - Bond is allowed by in [[Colonel Heller]]. Inside the room, Bond observes that the windows are made of bulletproof \"Armolite-III\", before trying to shake hands with Sanchez. However, Sanchez doesn't and Heller orders Bond to take a seat. Sanchez goes over Bond's things and inquires what Bond is doing in Isthmus. Bond presents himself as a gunman for hire, but Sanchez sees no need for a man like him. Sanchez informs Bond that he confiscates his passport and gun for the time being and tells Bond to enjoy his stay.\n\n===Assassination attempt===\nBond and Pam return to Hotel Mary Tierra, where at the lobby, the clerk informs that \"Bond's uncle\" has arrived and is at this suite. Bond fears its an MI6 agent trying to take him in, and at the elevator, Bond inquires Pam if she has a gun. She hands Bond her [[Beretta 950 Jetfire|Beretta Jetfire]] and Bond goes to investigate his hotel room.\n\nBond rushes inside his suite and finds a person there, swiftly throwing him down on the ground at gunpoint. But the person turns out to be [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]], who was on leave and only coming to help Bond out. Bond is surprised at Q's presence, with the latter informing the former that Moneypenny sent him and got worried about him, with Bond telling Q to leave due to the circumstances. Q refuses, as he knows better and telling Bond he already knows what he is doing, and presents Bond with [[gadgets]]. As Q is presenting the [[Dentonite Toothpaste]], Pam comes in with a gun drawn, but sees that there is no danger and introduces herself to Q.\n\nQ then presents the [[Signature Rifle]], with him programming its palm reader to only accept Bond's handprint. Pam fumbles with a [[Laser Polaroid Camera]], almost causing an accident. Bond tells everybody to take a rest, with Pam taking the main bed, forcing Bond and Q to share the two-bed room.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK Bond Heller Casino rappel.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bond by the window of Sanchez's office.]]\nNext night, Bond, Pam and Q head to Casino de Isthmus, where Sanchez is about to have a meeting with Asian drug traders regarding the expansion of Sanchez's businesses to Asia. Posing as one of the waiters, Bond gets to the roof of the casino in order to get to the Armolite-III windows of Sanchez's meeting room. Bond begins setting the plastic explosive paste from the Dentonite Toothpaste tube and then setting the [[Cigarette Packet Detonator]] for them. Meanwhile at the meeting, certain Kwang manages to convince the other investors to get to see the drugs processing plant, which gets Truman-Lodge antsy.\n\nBond gets out of the building and acquires the package containing the Signature Rifle from Q. He then orders Q to leave, as Bond leaves to the building on the opposite side of the window he set the plastic explosives to. Bond gets into position and surveys the building. While doing so, he spots Pam talking to Colonel Heller. He disregards it for the time being and spots Sanchez at his office. \n\nBond sets off the explosives which destroy the Armolite-II windows and attempts to fire -- only to be disrupted by gray-clad ninjas. Bond tries to fight them off, but they ultimately overwhelm him with a net weapon and take him out.\n\n===Hong Kong narcotics safehouse===\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK Bond Kwang HKNarco1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bond detained by the Hong Kong narcotics agents.]]\nA car arrives at a worn-out house at the outskirts of the city. Bond is awakened and has been tied up to a table, with the ninjas taking off their mask, revealing an male agent and a [[Loti|female agent]]. Kwang appears and inquires Bond's identity, before [[Fallon]] from MI6 entering and saying that Bond is a rogue MI6 agent. Agitated Kwang tells that he is a deep-cover agent working for [[Hong Kong Police Force]]'s narcotics unit, and berates Bond, for his assassination attempt may have ruined their years-long operation to find Sanchez's secret drug lab.\n\nFallon gets ready to take Bond away, but outside, [[Colonel Heller]] and a squadron of republic soldiers arrive with a [[M5 Stuart Tank|tank]]. Heller orders the tank to fire thrice, which devastates the safehouse. The three explosions kill Fallon and the other operative, while knocking out Bond and mortally injuring Kwang. The female agent is left to fend off on her own, and even though she kills a couple of the republic soldiers, she is shot and killed by Heller. \n\nSanchez arrives and browses the derelict safehouse with Heller and the republic soldiers. He finds near-dead Kwang, who takes cyanide and dies, with Sanchez shooting his corpse in anger. Sanchez then finds Bond, and determining that he has been tortured by Kwang and his collaborators, he may have trying to protect Sanchez from his enemies.\n\n===Winning over Sanchez and framing of Krest===\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK Bond Sanchez Villa Talk1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bond having a talk with Sanchez at the latter's villa.]]\nBond wakes up in panic at a bedroom within [[Sanchez's Villa]], but soon realizes that he is being welcomed by Sanchez. Bond gets dressed and leaves the room, finding Sanchez accompanied by Lupe.\n\nBond takes a seat and has a talk with Sanchez, who believes Bond was trying to foil the HKPF agents. Having Sanchez's ear, Bond convinces Sanchez that somebody within his cartel might be trying to kill him. Sanchez orders Bond to stay put, but Bond knows he has to leave before somebody within Sanchez' cartel can identify him.\n\nLupe helps Bond to get back to the city on a [[Supra Pirata|boat]] and Bond heads to Hotel Mary Tierra. At his suite, he grabs onto Pam and throws her onto the bed, taking the gun on her ankle holster and drawing it onto her face. Bond thinks Pam has betrayed him by meeting with Heller, but Pam says she got a agreement with Heller to help her get some [[Stinger missiles]] out of Sanchez's hands. But the deal with Heller has been called off due to Bond's failed assassination attempt and she reminds Bond that there is this more than just Bond's revenge. Bond apologizes and she - along with Q - agree to help Bond to trick Sanchez to turn against Krest, who is to arrive at nightfall.\n\nWavekrest arrives at Isthmus port and Pam - posing as inspector - gets aboard and causes the ship to crash across the harbor, with Sanchez seeing the crash. Amidst the confusion, Pam heads down below to the moon pool and lets Bond aboard. The two begin piling the money Bond stole from the seaplane to the chamber vault - which Bond spotted the money at the first time he got aboard.\n\nSanchez is meeting with Krest at his cabin in presence of Lupe. Krest, despite telling the truth, fails to convince the Sanchez. Meanwhile, Sanchez's men go around checking Wavekrest and arrive at the moon pool, with Bond and Pam hiding. The men spot the money at the chamber and head back to inform Sanchez of the discovery.\n\n[[File:FSanchezExecutesMKrest.jpeg|thumb|300px|right|Sanchez looking at Krest's bloody remains within the hyperbaric chamber.]]\nWith Bond observing in secret, Sanchez arrives to the moon pool and finds the money at the chamber. This sets Sanchez off, accusing Krest of using Sanchez's own money to try hire the assassins to kill him. He then traps Krest inside the hyperbaric chamber and then - by suddenly depressurizing the chamber with a fire axe - causes Krest to gruesomely explode. The villains leave and Bond dives out of the vessel, trying to reach Sanchez's villa before Lupe.\n\nBond makes it to Sanchez's villa before the latter arrives. Bond pretends to be sleep when Sanchez arrives, throwing a wad of cash at Bond for (supposedly) exposing Krest's treachery. Bond then deems that Krest might not have been alone to try conspire against Sanchez, with the drug lord inviting Bond to his secret drug lab.\n\nBond is then visited by Lupe who warns Bond to not accept to the secret lab, but they end up instead making love. Subsequently, Q and Pam are at the hotel suite, when Lupe comes looking for Bond. Pam assumed Bond had left the country, with Lupe telling Bond making love the her last night.\n\n===Arrival to the lab===\nSanchez's motorcade leaves to the secret drug lab, with Q is disguised as a street sweeper using the [[Rake Radio Transmitter]] to inform Pam of this development. Pam tries to secure a plane, but the one she arrived to country with has been dismantled. Meanwhile, Dario arrives in a [[Eurocopter AS355|AStar Helicopter]] to pick up Sanchez, showing him the Stinger missiles he has acquired from the Nicaraguan Contras (that Pam tried to get Heller to steal away).\n\nThe motorcade arrives to the [[Olympatec Meditation Institute]], with Truman-Lodge telling the clients that the grounds are a cover for Joe Butcher's religious cult, which unexpectedly started to turn a profit to Sanchez's cartel. Meanwhile, Pam has acquired a [[Piper PA-18-150 Super Cub|Super Cub crop duster]] and begins flying towards Bond's location.\n\nThe motorcade drives inside the temples, with Sanchez and Dario soon arriving by helicopter. Bond and the other participants attending are ordered to put on dust masks, and Truman-Lodge beings to tour them. Dario gets a quick glance of Bond and gets slightly alarmed by him, with Sanchez unaware of what Dario knows. Meanwhile, Pam arrives to the religious grounds in a hitch-hiked pick-up truck and uses money to convince the gate attendant to allow her to meet with Joe Butcher.\n\n[[File:License to kill-cov2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bond held at gunpoint by Dario at the drug lab, during Honorato's demonstration.]]\nBond is taken to the laboratory, where the chief chemist [[Honorato]] explains the secret of their cocaine smuggling method. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can render cocaine chemically undetectable by dissolving it in gasoline, and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers. The re-integration process will be available to those underworld clients who can pay Sanchez's price. While Bond is observing the process, Dario sneaks up on Bond with a [[Walther P5|gun]] drawn, ordering him to stay still.\n\nMeanwhile, Pam is delivered to Joe Butcher on a [[Taylor-Dunn Tee-Bird|cart]], with Butcher enchanted by Pam's presence. He directs her to his private sound-proofed sanctuary, possibly with the intention of molesting her, before Pam draws her ankle-holster Jetfire and orders Butcher to give her the keys to the facility. Pam gets the keys and locks Butcher inside, with Butcher sardonically wishing \"bless your heart\" to Pam.\n\nThe cocaine re-integration demonstration continues, with Dario still having Bond at gunpoint. When one of the clients asks if the cocaine can be destroyed if authorities get involved, Sanchez shows that the cocaine disguised as fuel can be set on fire. Seeing his opportunity, Bond headbutts Dario and grabs the burning dish and throws it at other chemical equipment, causing a severe fire to break out in the facility.\n\n===Fire at the lab===\n[[File:JBondCapturedByFSanchez.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sanchez barking orders while Bond is detained by Braun.]]\nEvacuation order is issued, with the clients being escorted out and the [[Kenworth W-900]] fuel tankers - loaded with the cocaine dissolved into gasoline - take off. Bond is pinned down while Dario shouts to Sanchez that Bond's involved with Leiter's informers. Furious Sanchez inquires Bond of his true intentions, before throwing him to the conveyor belt to the grinder. \n\nTied up and sliding towards the grinder, with attempts to not slide further disrupted by Sanchez kicking Bond's hands, he tries to get inside Sanchez's head again. Bond eventually gets Sanchez's attention when he mentions the Stinger missiles and that Heller has been asked to get them back. Sanchez thanks Bond for the tip and leaves Dario to deal with Bond.\n\nWhile everybody is escaping, Pam finds herself close to the conveyor belt. With Bond stuck at the edge of the grinder - hanging on by the ropes tied around his hands - Dario gets onto the conveyor belt and tries to cut them. Pam finally finds Bond, with Dario being amused to see Pam alive. \n\nPam shoots Dario, but her gun malfunctions after he hits him, with the gunshot wound hardly affecting Dario. Dario gets up and tries to attack Pam, but as his attention is off Bond, the latter grabs Dario's leg and makes him fall into the grinder. The grinder shreds Dario and Pam approaches Bond to ask if he is alright, with Bond yelling her to “switch the bloody machine off” and get him out of there.\n\n[[File:JBondPBouvierDeadHeller-RedLightEscape.jpeg|thumb|300px|left|Bond and Pam trying to find a way out from the burning drug lab, just as the forklift with Heller's body on it crashes through the wall.]]\nSanchez finds Heller trying to steal the Stingers from the helicopter, like Bond says he would, and assigns Braun to kill him. Bond and Pam appear to be trapped at the hangar, before a forklift with Heller skewered through breaks through a wall, creating a path for their escape.\n\nTruman-Lodge, trying run away on foot, gets picked up by Sanchez as gunpoint, ordering him to get aboard his [[Maserati Biturbo 425i|Maserati]]. Meanwhile, Bond and Pam get aboard the cart and leave the destructing Olympatec Meditation Institute. While driving out, Pam spots Joe Butcher and steals back her bag, with Butcher against sardonically wishing \"bless your heart\" at Pam.\n\nBond and Pam drive to the Super Cub plane and watch the Olympatec Meditation Institute being engulfed in fire and explosions. However, since the tankers carrying the cocaine have left and Sanchez is still alive, Bond orders Pam to get him to Sanchez's convoy.\n\n===Paso El Diablo===\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK BondLandRigPhoto1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|James Bond leaping onto one of Sanchez's tankers.]]\nThe tanker convoy - accompanied by passenger cars of Sanchez and his remaining men - continues its course along [[Paso El Diablo]]. Bond and Pam - latter flying the Super Cub - eventually find the convoy, with Bond telling Pam to drop him atop one of the tankers.\n\nBond leaps off from the crop duster and lands atop one of the tankers, with Sanchez spotting him in the act. Sanchez begins shooting at the truck with a [[Micro Uzi]] in hopes of hitting Bond, who temporarily slips between the truck cab and its container. Bond avoids Sanchez's gunfire under the tanker and eventually gets to the truck cab. Bond then tries to defeat the driver, who pulls out a [[machete]] to try fend off Bond. Bond gets a fire extinguisher and uses it to blind the driver, giving Bond a chance to shove the driver off the truck and onto Sanchez's Maserati.\n\nSanchez starts radio'ing Perez to get ready for him and shouts the tanker truck driver ahead of Bond to impede the hijacked truck's progress. Bond's truck reaches the other truck, and both start to colliding each other with intent to make them crash. Meanwhile Sanchez's Maserati reaches Perez's Jeep drive ahead, with Sanchez giving his lackeys some of the Stinger missiles to try kill Bond with.\n\nAfter bit more of clashing, Bond successfully veers the other tank into a cliff wall. Meanwhile, Perez and other spot Bond's tanker, with Perez preparing his Stinger Launcher. Bond realizes what's happening and drives over a pile of dug up ground, causing the his tanker [[Wikipedia:Ski (driving stunt)|to ski]]. Just then, Perez fires and the Stinger missile zooms just under Bond's skiing truck and hits the other tanker that Bond made to crash. Bond's tanker keeps skiing towards Perez and others, flee, as Bond's tanker returns to balance, crushing the Jeep used by the thugs.\n\nThen Perez and co. rush after Bond's tanker guns blazing, blowing up one of the tires on Bond's tanker. Bond's tanker skids and stops with its fuel container eking out the cliff. Perez and co. approach Bond, who is forced to take cover. Bond is then save when Pam flies over Perez and others, releasing the plane's crop dust over them, momentarily incapacitating them. Bond then sees the other two tankers and releases the container lock, causing it to slide down the hill and impacting one of the tankers, with the collision resulting in a big explosion. \n\nSanchez's Maserati pulls over and its occupants getting out to see the damage. Sanchez is already frustrated with Bond's actions, and when Truman-Lodge starts mouthing Sanchez off, the latter swiftly kills him with a quick Uzi blast. Sanchez orders his other henchman carrying Stinger missiles to accompany him, with Bond seeing this and returns to the truck cab to chase him down.\n\n===Bond vs. Sanchez===\nBond's truck leaves as Perez and co. arrive too late to stop it, only for Braun's [[Dodge Ram]] to arrive and the goons boarding it. Sanchez and the other henchman board the remaining tanker with a intact fuel container, while the two collided tanks explode again, creating a wall of fire. Bond's truck arrives to the firewall with the Dodge Ram nearing him. Bond makes the truck do a wheelie and gets over the wall of fire - making it through intact - while Perez and Braun deciding to drive through, with the three other henchmen realizing it to be a bad idea and jump off. The Dodge Ram drives through, catching fire.\n\nBond nears Sanchez's tanker, with Pam arriving in the Super Cub. Sanchez sprays his Uzi at Bond's tanker and runs out of ammo, with Bond then engaging the cruise control to keep the tanker going so that he can leap onto Sanchez's tanker off the own tanker's hood.\n\nSanchez orders the driver to give him the Stinger launcher, while Bond grabs onto the ladder of Sanchez's tanker. Perez and Braun arrive in the Dodge Ram and shoot at Bond, who opens the container's vault to let out some gasoline, which the burning Dodge Ram sets on fire. The fire from the gasoline trail blinds the Dodge Ram, with Perez and Braun driving off a cliff to their deaths.\n\nSanchez spots Pam's Super Cub following them, and gets the Stinger to shoot her down. The Stinger missile blows through the rear tail of Pam's Super Cub, causing her to fly away and land somewhere. Sanchez orders the driver to stop the truck, with Bond jolted into the area between the truck cab and the container. Sanchez attacks with a machete, cutting various lines connected between the truck and container, including the brake fuel, which causes the truck to start moving on its own. Pam lands her plane and gets out, soon spotting the truck that was left on cruise control by Bond.\n\nBond and Sanchez fight at the back of the truck's container, and as the truck nears a crag without the breaks, the driver bails out. The truck veers off a hill and rolls over, with the crash causing a large dust cloud. The fuel container is ruptured, with injured Bond trying to crawl away from it. \n\n[[File:Sanchez's death.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bond setting Sanchez on fire with the lighter gifted by Felix and Della.]]\nAfter a moment, gasoline-soaked Sanchez appears with his machete drawn at Bond's face. Murderous looking Sanchez grabs Bond and throws him at a rock, telling him that Bond \"could have had everything\" while Bond searches his pockets. As Sanchez is about to cleave Bond with his machete, Bond then offers to reveal why he ruined Sanchez and shows the Leiter Lighter that was given to him at the wedding. \n\nBond flicks the lighter and sets gasoline soaked Sanchez on fire. Bond flees as Sanchez - burning alive - stumbles into the wrecked tanker truck's cistern, causing it to explode in a massive fireball. Bond gets out and watches on as the grueling battle to avenge his comrade is finished. Pam arrives in the remaining truck, asking Bond aboard.\n\n===Epilogue===\nLater, Bond, Bouvier and Q are attending a party at Sanchez's residence. Bond is talking to Felix Leiter - who has regained consciousness after the attack - over the phone, agreeing for a fishing trip the next week. Leiter also tells that M called, saying that he \"has a job\" for Bond and tried to reach him, informing that Bond is reinstated to MI6, but Bond has to end the call when Lupe appears. \n\n[[File:11-311878 0x420.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bond and Pam sharing a romantic moment at the pool.]]\nBond has a chat with Lupe, who has gotten the jewelry off late Sanchez's Iguana. While Q and Pam are talking with each other, Lupe expresses her gratitude to Bond by giving him a kiss. Pam and Q see this, with the former getting upset about it and leaving the floor while tearing up. Bond rebuffs Lupe's offer to stay in Istmus with her, but he excuses himself to go see Pam.\n\nBond sees Pam by the pool below quietly crying. As President Hector Lopez arrives by Lupe, Bond thinks she should form a relationship with \"El Presidente\" instead, and jumps to the pool below. Pam is cheered up from seeing Bond and offers to get him out of the pool, only for Bond to pull her in as well. The two share a passionate kiss as Lopez, Lupe and Q watch over the balcony, before giving them privacy.",
    "Capture of Sanchez": "[[File:FelixSharkeyBond-OnWayToWedding.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|James Bond - the best man in the renewal wedding - showing the wedding ring to Leiter.]]\nThe story opens with the [[United States Coast Guard]] AWACS-plane confirming the arrival of South American drug lord [[Franz Sanchez]] to Cray Cay in Havana. As Sanchez is now within United States jurisdiction, they inform the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) unit at Key West, Florida, in hopes that if they act fast, they could \"grab the bastard.\"\n\n[[James Bond (Timothy Dalton)|James Bond]], his American friend, [[Felix Leiter (David Hedison)|Felix Leiter]] (working a joint task force between the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]) and their local friend [[Sharkey]] are on their way to Leiter's vow renewal on a Rolls-Royce, driving on the Overseas Highway. As Leiter if Bond - the best man - still has the wedding ring ready, a Coast Guard [[Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin|HH-65 helicopter]] appears, signaling Leiter to pull over. Finding a good spot, the helicopter lands, with DEA agents [[Hawkins]] and [[Mullens]] getting out and telling Leiter that Sanchez is in the Bahamas. Leiter grabs on to this vital moment, with Bond accompanying him to operation, while the two leave Sharkey to go explain Felix's wife, [[Della]] about the delay.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Sanchez Cartel]] gangsters stake out a hiding house in the Cray Key, killing the guards there. Sanchez finds his mistress - [[Lupe Lamora]] - in bed with [[Alvarez|another man]]; and in retaliation for her infidelity, he has his henchman [[Dario]] cut out the man's heart while he brutally whips his mistress. \n\n[[File:007 Mid-Air-Hiest LANDSCAPE.webp|thumb|right|250px|James Bond rappelling from a helicopter to try hook up Sanchez's escape plane.]]\nBond, Felix and the DEA agents reach the Cray Key hideout and quickly get in a fire fight with Sanchez's men. After having seemingly repelled Sanchez's henchmen, Bond spots Lupe, who promptly leaves. \n\nFelix and others then hear some noise, as during the firefight, Sanchez has managed to sneak aboard a [[Cessna 172|small Cessna plane]] and attempts to escape, potentially once more eluding the DEA's grasp. Bond and co. pursue in the USCG helicopter, and with Bond managing to lock a hook-on Sanchez's plane, they finally capture the ever-elusive drug baron. Afterwards, Bond and Leiter parachute down to the church and the ceremony begins.",
    "Wedding party": "Sanchez is escorted to a Coast Guard interrogation block in Florida, where is being hounded by DEA Agent [[Ed Killifer]], who apparently takes offense at Sanchez's nonchalant attempt to bribe other law enforcement officials with two million US dollars. Meanwhile, a big party is going on at Felix Leiter's home. Leiter is at this home office and Della asks Bond to go ask him to stop working and join the guests. \n\nAt the room, Bond catches a glimpse of a mysterious woman (later revealed to be [[Pam Bouvier]]) who swiftly leaves, with Leiter busy filing a report about Sanchez's capture and tells how difficult it has been to try achieve it. They are then joined by Killifer, who tells them that he's going to accompany the convoy escorting Sanchez to Quantico, Virginia. Killifer leaves, with Bond present to see Leiter hide a disc (containing info regarding investigations on Sanchez) behind a framed picture. The party continues, with Leiter gifting Bond a [[Leiter Lighter]] with an oversized flame jet. \n\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK Van Dive.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kilifer driving the armored van carrying Sanchez off the Overseas Highway bridge.]]\nMeanwhile, the Floridian police convoy begins escorting Sanchez in a armored van along the Overseas Highway (US Route 1). Killifer is with the front seats of the armored van, and the convoy reaches \"Bridge Under Repair\" sign, it prompts Killifer to use the butt of his shotgun to knock out the driver and takes control of the armored van. He careens the armored van off the bridge and into the water, and as the van sinks, scuba divers appear and they rescue Sanchez and Killifer, taking the two aboard a [[Shark Hunter II Submersible|small submersible]].\n\nLater in the evening, Felix and Della are offering farewells to departing Bond, with Della throwing her wedding garter to Bond. Bond gives a sad smile to hide his pained memories, with Felix telling Della that Bond too [[Tracy Bond (Diana Rigg)|was once married]], which ended in tragedy. As Felix and Della head inside, they are ambushed at their bedroom and captured by Sanchez's enforcer [[Dario]] and several of Sanchez's henchmen.",
    "The mauling": "Blindfolded Leiter is taken to [[Ocean Exotica Warehouse]], operated by marine researcher [[Milton Krest]], who is one of Sanchez's drug smugglers. At his office booth, Krest talks with Sanchez, with the former being antsy about how latter conducts his business. Sanchez says that he will wait for Dario and that he is going to reward Killifer, because to him, loyalty is more important than money. Sanchez asks Killifer to the office and gives him a heavy suitcase containing the 2 million dollars of bribe money. Then Dario comes and Sanchez goes to see Leiter, after warning Krest to not fool around with Lupe.\n\n[[File:Ocean Exotica warehouse 2.png|thumb|right|300px|Leiter confronted by Sanchez and his men at the Ocean Exotica Warehouse.]]\nLeiter is brought to the middle of the warehouse, with Dario removing his blinds and Sanchez appears in front of him. As Leiter asks what has happened to his wife, Dario darkly quips that he and Sanchez's men gave her \"a nice honeymoon.\" Leiter becomes engraged and Sanchez drily informs that, what he is about to do, he is not doing out of personal reasons, but for business reason. Sanchez makes his men open the [[Shark Tank]] and Killifer appears, with Leiter realizing he has betrayed DEA.\n\nLeiter is attached to a hook and Sanchez's men throw a large meat slab of a slaughtered animal into the shark tank. As the sharks eat the meat, Leiter is gradually lowered down. As Leiter curses Sanchez, the latter informs him that he plans to have Felix to be maimed by the sharks, but not to die. The sharks tear into Leiter, with the reactions of Sanchez's collaborators divided between twisted amusement and nauseation over the gory display.\n\nThe next morning, Bond arrives to the [[Key West International Airport]] in a [[Lincoln Mark VII LSC]]. While Bond is having his ticket checked for his flight at the reception, he hears about some commotion and inquires it. The clerk tells that \"some big drug dealer\" has escaped and - realizing the implications - Bond bolts out of the airport.\n\n[[File:Ltk bond finds felix.webp|thumb|left|250px|Bond finds maimed Felix at latter's home.]]\nBond arrives back to Leiter's home and investigates the quiet house. Soon enough, Bond finds Della in her wedding dress, dead. In the study - which has been thoroughly ransacked by Sanchez's thugs - Bond finds Felix, maimed but still alive, bearing a note from Sanchez: \"He disagreed with something that ate him.\" Bond becomes outraged about this, but hears phone ringing and answers, demanding the caller to get an ambulance.\n\nLocal police arrive to investigate Leiter's house, while he is taken to a hospital and a detective will give Bond questions about the murder. Bond is soon joined by Sharkey, with the police - lead by [[Rasmussen]] - thinking that Leiter's wounds are result of a chainsaw used by Columbian gangsters. Bond and Sharkey then see Leiter at hospital, where Sharkey deems that Leiter's wounds are definitely a result from a shark bite. DEA agent [[Hawkins]], who was with Bond when they captured Sanchez the first time, comes to see Leiter and tells that the trail on Sanchez has gone cold. Bond becomes upset about the local law enforcement's unwillingness to do anything and decides to take matters into his own hands.",
    "Investigation of Ocean Exotica": "Bond and Sharkey go around Key West to try find a place that would have the sharks that Sanchez used to maim Leiter. After having searched some off-screen, they arrive at the Ocean Exotica Warehouse as the last possible location. Krest orders Killifer to stay hidden, as a [[Bill|guard named Bill]] answers and tries to shoo away Bond. But when Bond presents himself as a international sealife trader from London, Krest deems to allow Bond in. \n\nKrest half-heartedly tours Bond around the warehouse and explains that he no longer has sharks, but conducts research on genetically modified fish. After Bond inquires about the submersible, which Krest explains is for sale, he appears come to a dead end. That is until he spots one of Della's wedding garters amongst swept up dirt and Bond tries to graciously leave without raising Krest's suspicions further.\n\nCome night-time, Bond and Sharkey attempt to infiltrate the warehouse to find clues regarding its involvement with Sanchez. As they are infiltrating by the pier connecting to the warehouse, they see the small submersible leaving. Bond gets access under the the warehouse and begins searching the place. Bond eventually checks a drawer full of wriggling maggots - meant as nutrition for the genetically modified fish - and sticks his hands in it, finding bags of cocaine. \n\nAs his hands are still there, Bill catches Bond at gunpoint and tries to detain him. As Bond requests that he is allowed to atleast get his hands out of the bed of maggots, he uses it as chance to grab a fistful of them and throws them at Bill, staggering him. Bond then knocks out Bill and throws him on the bed of maggots and slams the drawer close, quipping \"bon appétit.\" As he does so, the second guard opens fire on Bond with an [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5 submachinegun]]. Bond dodges the gunfire, which breaks the equipment and aquarium full of fish. As the guard loses sight on Bond, he walks down the stairs to try find him, only for Bond to use a hook and pull him into a aquarium containing an electric eel, which electrocutes the guard to death.\n\n[[File:BONDWIKI LTK Bond Sharkey Killifer Photo1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|James Bond about to punish Killifer for his corruption.]]\nBond gets out of hiding, only to be immediately get ambushed by Killifer - carrying a revolver and the bribe money suitcase - who orders Bond to freeze. With his gun drawn, Killifer orders Bond over the trap door, with Bond correctly deducing that it has the sharks that maimed Felix. Killifer walks on the other trap door - that Bond entered through from the pier - and toggles the doors for the shark tank. As Killifer cocks his gun, Sharkey gets through the pier trap door, which knocks the former off balance and giving Bond the opportunity to overpower Killifer.\n\nBond punches Killifer, who backpedals on some chains over the shark tank. Precariously balancing on the edge in order to not fall in, Killifer begans bargaining with Bond, offering to split the 2 million dollars of bribe money. Silently wrathful Bond grabs the suitcase and throws it at Killifer, with the corrupt DEA agents falling into the shark tank and getting swiftly torn apart by the sharks. Seeing the open suitcase and money in the water, Sharkey deems it a terrible waste... of money.",
    "Licence to Kill is revoked": "The next morning, Bond and Sharkey are aboard the latter's fishing boat, [[Pa-Ja-Ma]], going over the next phase of the investigation involving Krest's seavessel, the [[Wavekrest]]. However, as Bond is taking a stroll at streets of Key West, he is approached by Hawkins. Hawkins informs that local authorities are inspecting the Ocean Exotica Warehouse and that he doesn't approve of Bond's vigilantism. Bond tries to ethicize with Hawkins regarding the injustice done to Leiter, but the latter informs the former that he is taken to see someone.\n\n[[File:JamesBond (TimothyDalton).png|thumb|left|300px|James Bond being confronted by M at the Ernest Hemingway House.]]\nBond is escorted to the [[Ernest Hemingway House]], where Bond is confronted by an irate and disappointed [[M (Robert Brown)|M]], who inquires him about his failing to head to [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] for his next assignment and orders him to be on a plane this afternoon as he has a job to do. Bond explains he hasn't finished his revenge yet, but M tells Bond to let the Americans handle it. Bond implores that he owes it to Leiter to take down Sanchez and his cartel. But M rejects Bond's rationalizations and orders to drop the pursuit or it may compromise Her Majesty's government and orders Bond to do the assignment objectively and professionally. Refusing to let the matter go, Bond declares his resignation, with M sternly telling Bond that he will not be kicked out, but he is grounded for insubordination and thusly his [[licence to kill]] is revoked for the time being. Bond then disobeys M's orders and escapes MI6 custody, becoming a rogue agent bereft of MI6's backing. M is shocked to see that Bond has escaped and remarks, \"God help you, commander!\".",
    "Wavekrest": "The scene changes to Wavekrest, where Lupe is at her cabin. Drunken Krest comes in, blaming her for the loss of Ocean Exotica warehouse to Key West authorities and warning that Sanchez may punish her for it. One of Krest's crew comes in and tells that they have something peculiar on radar, and upon reaching the ships bridge and observing the camera footage, he dismisses it as a manta ray. Unbeknownst to bridge crew, the manta ray is actually a decoy used by Bond for him to get close and grab onto one of the tows going inside Wavekrest.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK BondLupeKrest Wavekrest.jpg|thumb|right|300px|James Bond making Lupe to answer to Krest.]]\nBond succeeds in getting in and knocks out a guard, hiding him inside a vaulted chamber where he sees stacks of money wrapped in blue plastic. Bond sneaks around, but while doing so, another guard finds the guard that Bond knocked out. Bond finds Lupe's cabin and surprises her at knifepoint, ordering her to stay silent. Krest comes knocking and Bond makes Lupe answer, successfully convincing that Bond is not there. Bond then observes Lupe's bruises and she tries to justify them. Bond keeps talking to Lupe until something starts to happen outside.\n\nBond looks through the blinders and sees the Pa-Ja-Ma coming closer. He spots dead Sharkey hoisted on it, with a frogman named [[Clive]], who apparently killed Sharkey, making fun of his death. This enrages Bond and Lupe criticizes his mindset, with Bond clapping back before storming out of the cabin. Bond reaches the deck, complete out in the open, and grabs a [[speargun]]. As Clive climbs out of the water, Bond points the speargun and fires a harpoon right into Clive's stomach.\n\nThis alarms Krest and his men begin firing at Bond. Bond dives into the water with a oxygen tank, but Krest orders the frogmen under him to go dive after him. Meanwhile, a [[Cessna A185F|Skywagon seaplane]] arrives to the location, to transport the drug money. Bond finds one of the tows going into Wavekrest and destroys the cocaine it carries with his knife.\n\nBond rises from the water - which is now bleached white from the cocaine - only to attract a boat full of Krest's men to attack him. The frogmen find Bond hand he fights them, stealing one of the spearguns which he uses to grapple onto the pontoons of the seaplane. The seaplane begins to take off, with it pulling Bond onto the surface and making him essentially waterski without the skis. The seaplane keeps pulling Bond as Krest's men on the boat try to shoot Bond.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK Bond holdon seaplane.jpg|thumb|left|300px|James Bond holding onto the seaplane taking off.]]\nBond eventually maneuvers himself to latch on the seaplane's pontoons, just as the seaplane finally gets off the water. Bond climbs over the seaplane and as one of the drug dealers tries to over if he can find him, Bond gets inside and pulls the emergency door release lock to send the other drug dealer flying out. But the pilot knocks Bond into the back seats, with him drawing his revolver and trying to shoot Bond. \n\nBond uses the money bags to absorb the bullets and then uses it to hammer the pilot, who rocks the plane that almost causes Bond to fall off. Bond manages to kick the pilot unconscious and takes over the plane, eventually dropping the pilot out in the eyesight of Krest and others. Bond then leaves the scene in a streak of dollar bills flying out of the seaplane, and with immense amounts of money to finance his quest of vengeance against Sanchez.",
    "Barrelhead Bar": "After getting back on mainland, Bond heads back to Leiter's home, sneaking past police barricade tapes. Remembering the CD that Leiter hid behind the framed picture, Bond finds it and inserts it in Leiter's computer. Accessing the data on the CD, Bond finds a list of informants, with all having been killed except for one \"P.

Pam inquires if Bond has a gun and shows her his shoulder holster [[PPK]], that Pam is not too impressed by. She gives Bond a glimpse of her [[Mossberg 500 Cruiser|pump-action shotgun]] under the table and instructs Bond what to do. \n\nDario and one of his men seat by Bond and Pam's table, with Dario telling what he knows as Pam's background in flying charter planes for the Nicaraguan Contras. Dario wants to take Pam outside, but Bond barks at Dario to keep his hands off her and as Dario dismisses Bond, Pam then shoves her shotgun at Dario's crotch. When the waitress brings the beverages, Dario's companion tries to attack Bond, whom he subdues. Pam asks if Bond has a getaway vehicle and he confirms that he has a boat behind the wall they are sitting at.\n\nDario tries to pull a fast one and Pam fires the shotgun, missing him. Bar fight ensues with Bond and Pam fighting off Dario and his men being obstructed by panicked customers at the bar. After brawling and viying for position to escape, Bond and Pam are finally able to explode a hole in a wall with Pam's shotgun. Pam orders Bond to get the boat ready while she keeps Dario's men in check.

    "Arrival to Isthmus": "Subsequently, Bond and Pam arrive to [[Republic of Isthmus]], which is ostensibly run by \"El Presidente\" [[Hector Lopez]], but is effectively a narcostate that's shadow governed by Sanchez and his cartel. They first make shop at [[Hotel Mary Tierra]], where they discuss about their cover identities, giving money to Pam to get a do-over so that she looks like Bond's secretary.\n\nBond then takes the money he stole from the seaplane that visited Wavekrest and brings it to [[Banco de Isthmus]] to open an account and make a deposit. He visits a [[Montelongo|bank manager]], who is initially dismissive of Bond, but immediately changes tone when he brings his luggage full of money. All the while, Sanchez is visiting the bank with his accountant/financial advisor - [[Truman-Lodge]] - touring investors (including [[Kwang]]) around the bank. While Bond is negotiating with the bank manager, Pam returns to Bond, with a glossed-up look.\n\nLater that day, we see Sanchez is at his office atop [[Casino de Isthmus]], where he and Truman-Lodge are is observing a TV broadcast by televangelist [[Joe Butcher]]. Sanchez's cartel uses Butcher's broadcast as means of communicating with their clients and setting pricing for their cocaine sales. Sanchez then has a short talk with Lupe regarding what happened at Wavekrest.\n\n[[File:Dalton blackjack.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bond and Pam at Casino de Isthmus.]]\nBond and Pam visit the Casino de Isthmus's main gambling lobby, with the former starting to gamble with high bets to attract Sanchez's attention. Sanchez sends Lupe to check on Bond and as she deals cards, she informs Bond's about the danger he is in, if he pursues further. Regardless, Bond makes her to take him to Sanchez, while Pam was pre-occupied with ordering a drink to Bond.\n\nAfter Bond is searched for weapons - with Sanchez's thugs finding Bond's PPK - Bond is allowed by in [[Colonel Heller]]. Inside the room, Bond observes that the windows are made of bulletproof \"Armolite-III\", before trying to shake hands with Sanchez. However, Sanchez doesn't and Heller orders Bond to take a seat. Sanchez goes over Bond's things and inquires what Bond is doing in Isthmus. Bond presents himself as a gunman for hire, but Sanchez sees no need for a man like him. Sanchez informs Bond that he confiscates his passport and gun for the time being and tells Bond to enjoy his stay.",
    "Assassination attempt": "Bond and Pam return to Hotel Mary Tierra, where at the lobby, the clerk informs that \"Bond's uncle\" has arrived and is at this suite. Bond fears its an MI6 agent trying to take him in, and at the elevator, Bond inquires Pam if she has a gun. She hands Bond her [[Beretta 950 Jetfire|Beretta Jetfire]] and Bond goes to investigate his hotel room.\n\nBond rushes inside his suite and finds a person there, swiftly throwing him down on the ground at gunpoint. But the person turns out to be [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]], who was on leave and only coming to help Bond out. Bond is surprised at Q's presence, with the latter informing the former that Moneypenny sent him and got worried about him, with Bond telling Q to leave due to the circumstances. Q refuses, as he knows better and telling Bond he already knows what he is doing, and presents Bond with [[gadgets]]. As Q is presenting the [[Dentonite Toothpaste]], Pam comes in with a gun drawn, but sees that there is no danger and introduces herself to Q.\n\nQ then presents the [[Signature Rifle]], with him programming its palm reader to only accept Bond's handprint. Pam fumbles with a [[Laser Polaroid Camera]], almost causing an accident. Bond tells everybody to take a rest, with Pam taking the main bed, forcing Bond and Q to share the two-bed room.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki LTK Bond Heller Casino rappel.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bond by the window of Sanchez's office.]]\nNext night, Bond, Pam and Q head to Casino de Isthmus, where Sanchez is about to have a meeting with Asian drug traders regarding the expansion of Sanchez's businesses to Asia. Posing as one of the waiters, Bond gets to the roof of the casino in order to get to the Armolite-III windows of Sanchez's meeting room. Bond begins setting the plastic explosive paste from the Dentonite Toothpaste tube and then setting the [[Cigarette Packet Detonator]] for them. Meanwhile at the meeting, certain Kwang manages to convince the other investors to get to see the drugs processing plant, which gets Truman-Lodge antsy.\n\nBond gets out of the building and acquires the package containing the Signature Rifle from Q. He then orders Q to leave, as Bond leaves to the building on the opposite side of the window he set the plastic explosives to. Bond gets into position and surveys the building. While doing so, he spots Pam talking to Colonel Heller. He disregards it for the time being and spots Sanchez at his office. \n\nBond sets off the explosives which destroy the Armolite-II windows and attempts to fire -- only to be disrupted by gray-clad ninjas. Bond tries to fight them off, but they ultimately overwhelm him with a net weapon and take him out.",
    "Hong Kong narcotics safehouse": "[[File:Bondwiki LTK Bond Kwang HKNarco1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bond detained by the Hong Kong narcotics agents.]]\nA car arrives at a worn-out house at the outskirts of the city. Bond is awakened and has been tied up to a table, with the ninjas taking off their mask, revealing an male agent and a [[Loti|female agent]]. Kwang appears and inquires Bond's identity, before [[Fallon]] from MI6 entering and saying that Bond is a rogue MI6 agent. Agitated Kwang tells that he is a deep-cover agent working for [[Hong Kong Police Force]]'s narcotics unit, and berates Bond, for his assassination attempt may have ruined their years-long operation to find Sanchez's secret drug lab.\n\nFallon gets ready to take Bond away, but outside, [[Colonel Heller]] and a squadron of republic soldiers arrive with a [[M5 Stuart Tank|tank]]. Heller orders the tank to fire thrice, which devastates the safehouse. The three explosions kill Fallon and the other operative, while knocking out Bond and mortally injuring Kwang. The female agent is left to fend off on her own, and even though she kills a couple of the republic soldiers, she is shot and killed by Heller. \n\nSanchez arrives and browses the derelict safehouse with Heller and the republic soldiers. He finds near-dead Kwang, who takes cyanide and dies, with Sanchez shooting his corpse in anger. Sanchez then finds Bond, and determining that he has been tortured by Kwang and his collaborators, he may have trying to protect Sanchez from his enemies.",
    "Winning over Sanchez and framing of Krest": "[[File:Bondwiki LTK Bond Sanchez Villa Talk1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bond having a talk with Sanchez at the latter's villa.]]\nBond wakes up in panic at a bedroom within [[Sanchez's Villa]], but soon realizes that he is being welcomed by Sanchez. Bond gets dressed and leaves the room, finding Sanchez accompanied by Lupe.\n\nBond takes a seat and has a talk with Sanchez, who believes Bond was trying to foil the HKPF agents. Having Sanchez's ear, Bond convinces Sanchez that somebody within his cartel might be trying to kill him. Sanchez orders Bond to stay put, but Bond knows he has to leave before somebody within Sanchez' cartel can identify him.\n\nLupe helps Bond to get back to the city on a [[Supra Pirata|boat]] and Bond heads to Hotel Mary Tierra. At his suite, he grabs onto Pam and throws her onto the bed, taking the gun on her ankle holster and drawing it onto her face. Bond thinks Pam has betrayed him by meeting with Heller, but Pam says she got a agreement with Heller to help her get some [[Stinger missiles]] out of Sanchez's hands. But the deal with Heller has been called off due to Bond's failed assassination attempt and she reminds Bond that there is this more than just Bond's revenge. Bond apologizes and she - along with Q - agree to help Bond to trick Sanchez to turn against Krest, who is to arrive at nightfall.\n\nWavekrest arrives at Isthmus port and Pam - posing as inspector - gets aboard and causes the ship to crash across the harbor, with Sanchez seeing the crash. Amidst the confusion, Pam heads down below to the moon pool and lets Bond aboard. The two begin piling the money Bond stole from the seaplane to the chamber vault - which Bond spotted the money at the first time he got aboard.\n\nSanchez is meeting with Krest at his cabin in presence of Lupe. Krest, despite telling the truth, fails to convince the Sanchez. Meanwhile, Sanchez's men go around checking Wavekrest and arrive at the moon pool, with Bond and Pam hiding. The men spot the money at the chamber and head back to inform Sanchez of the discovery.\n\n[[File:FSanchezExecutesMKrest.jpeg|thumb|300px|right|Sanchez looking at Krest's bloody remains within the hyperbaric chamber.]]\nWith Bond observing in secret, Sanchez arrives to the moon pool and finds the money at the chamber. This sets Sanchez off, accusing Krest of using Sanchez's own money to try hire the assassins to kill him. He then traps Krest inside the hyperbaric chamber and then - by suddenly depressurizing the chamber with a fire axe - causes Krest to gruesomely explode. The villains leave and Bond dives out of the vessel, trying to reach Sanchez's villa before Lupe.\n\nBond makes it to Sanchez's villa before the latter arrives. Bond pretends to be sleep when Sanchez arrives, throwing a wad of cash at Bond for (supposedly) exposing Krest's treachery. Bond then deems that Krest might not have been alone to try conspire against Sanchez, with the drug lord inviting Bond to his secret drug lab.\n\nBond is then visited by Lupe who warns Bond to not accept to the secret lab, but they end up instead making love. Subsequently, Q and Pam are at the hotel suite, when Lupe comes looking for Bond. Pam assumed Bond had left the country, with Lupe telling Bond making love the her last night.",
    "Arrival to the lab": "Sanchez's motorcade leaves to the secret drug lab, with Q is disguised as a street sweeper using the [[Rake Radio Transmitter]] to inform Pam of this development. Pam tries to secure a plane, but the one she arrived to country with has been dismantled. Meanwhile, Dario arrives in a [[Eurocopter AS355|AStar Helicopter]] to pick up Sanchez, showing him the Stinger missiles he has acquired from the Nicaraguan Contras (that Pam tried to get Heller to steal away).\n\nThe motorcade arrives to the [[Olympatec Meditation Institute]], with Truman-Lodge telling the clients that the grounds are a cover for Joe Butcher's religious cult, which unexpectedly started to turn a profit to Sanchez's cartel. Meanwhile, Pam has acquired a [[Piper PA-18-150 Super Cub|Super Cub crop duster]] and begins flying towards Bond's location.\n\nThe motorcade drives inside the temples, with Sanchez and Dario soon arriving by helicopter. Bond and the other participants attending are ordered to put on dust masks, and Truman-Lodge beings to tour them. Dario gets a quick glance of Bond and gets slightly alarmed by him, with Sanchez unaware of what Dario knows. Meanwhile, Pam arrives to the religious grounds in a hitch-hiked pick-up truck and uses money to convince the gate attendant to allow her to meet with Joe Butcher.\n\n[[File:License to kill-cov2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bond held at gunpoint by Dario at the drug lab, during Honorato's demonstration.]]\nBond is taken to the laboratory, where the chief chemist [[Honorato]] explains the secret of their cocaine smuggling method. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can render cocaine chemically undetectable by dissolving it in gasoline, and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers. The re-integration process will be available to those underworld clients who can pay Sanchez's price. While Bond is observing the process, Dario sneaks up on Bond with a [[Walther P5|gun]] drawn, ordering him to stay still.\n\nMeanwhile, Pam is delivered to Joe Butcher on a [[Taylor-Dunn Tee-Bird|cart]], with Butcher enchanted by Pam's presence. He directs her to his private sound-proofed sanctuary, possibly with the intention of molesting her, before Pam draws her ankle-holster Jetfire and orders Butcher to give her the keys to the facility. Pam gets the keys and locks Butcher inside, with Butcher sardonically wishing \"bless your heart\" to Pam.\n\nThe cocaine re-integration demonstration continues, with Dario still having Bond at gunpoint. When one of the clients asks if the cocaine can be destroyed if authorities get involved, Sanchez shows that the cocaine disguised as fuel can be set on fire. Seeing his opportunity, Bond headbutts Dario and grabs the burning dish and throws it at other chemical equipment, causing a severe fire to break out in the facility.",
    "Fire at the lab": "[[File:JBondCapturedByFSanchez.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sanchez barking orders while Bond is detained by Braun.]]\nEvacuation order is issued, with the clients being escorted out and the [[Kenworth W-900]] fuel tankers - loaded with the cocaine dissolved into gasoline - take off. Bond is pinned down while Dario shouts to Sanchez that Bond's involved with Leiter's informers. Furious Sanchez inquires Bond of his true intentions, before throwing him to the conveyor belt to the grinder. \n\nTied up and sliding towards the grinder, with attempts to not slide further disrupted by Sanchez kicking Bond's hands, he tries to get inside Sanchez's head again. Bond eventually gets Sanchez's attention when he mentions the Stinger missiles and that Heller has been asked to get them back. Sanchez thanks Bond for the tip and leaves Dario to deal with Bond.\n\nWhile everybody is escaping, Pam finds herself close to the conveyor belt. With Bond stuck at the edge of the grinder - hanging on by the ropes tied around his hands - Dario gets onto the conveyor belt and tries to cut them. Pam finally finds Bond, with Dario being amused to see Pam alive. \n\nPam shoots Dario, but her gun malfunctions after he hits him, with the gunshot wound hardly affecting Dario. Dario gets up and tries to attack Pam, but as his attention is off Bond, the latter grabs Dario's leg and makes him fall into the grinder. The grinder shreds Dario and Pam approaches Bond to ask if he is alright, with Bond yelling her to “switch the bloody machine off” and get him out of there.\n\n[[File:JBondPBouvierDeadHeller-RedLightEscape.jpeg|thumb|300px|left|Bond and Pam trying to find a way out from the burning drug lab, just as the forklift with Heller's body on it crashes through the wall.]]\nSanchez finds Heller trying to steal the Stingers from the helicopter, like Bond says he would, and assigns Braun to kill him. Bond and Pam appear to be trapped at the hangar, before a forklift with Heller skewered through breaks through a wall, creating a path for their escape.\n\nTruman-Lodge, trying run away on foot, gets picked up by Sanchez as gunpoint, ordering him to get aboard his [[Maserati Biturbo 425i|Maserati]]. Meanwhile, Bond and Pam get aboard the cart and leave the destructing Olympatec Meditation Institute. While driving out, Pam spots Joe Butcher and steals back her bag, with Butcher against sardonically wishing \"bless your heart\" at Pam.\n\nBond and Pam drive to the Super Cub plane and watch the Olympatec Meditation Institute being engulfed in fire and explosions. However, since the tankers carrying the cocaine have left and Sanchez is still alive, Bond orders Pam to get him to Sanchez's convoy.",
    "Paso El Diablo": "[[File:Bondwiki LTK BondLandRigPhoto1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|James Bond leaping onto one of Sanchez's tankers.]]\nThe tanker convoy - accompanied by passenger cars of Sanchez and his remaining men - continues its course along [[Paso El Diablo]]. Bond and Pam - latter flying the Super Cub - eventually find the convoy, with Bond telling Pam to drop him atop one of the tankers.\n\nBond leaps off from the crop duster and lands atop one of the tankers, with Sanchez spotting him in the act. Sanchez begins shooting at the truck with a [[Micro Uzi]] in hopes of hitting Bond, who temporarily slips between the truck cab and its container. Bond avoids Sanchez's gunfire under the tanker and eventually gets to the truck cab. Bond then tries to defeat the driver, who pulls out a [[machete]] to try fend off Bond. Bond gets a fire extinguisher and uses it to blind the driver, giving Bond a chance to shove the driver off the truck and onto Sanchez's Maserati.\n\nSanchez starts radio'ing Perez to get ready for him and shouts the tanker truck driver ahead of Bond to impede the hijacked truck's progress. Bond's truck reaches the other truck, and both start to colliding each other with intent to make them crash. Meanwhile Sanchez's Maserati reaches Perez's Jeep drive ahead, with Sanchez giving his lackeys some of the Stinger missiles to try kill Bond with.\n\nAfter bit more of clashing, Bond successfully veers the other tank into a cliff wall. Meanwhile, Perez and other spot Bond's tanker, with Perez preparing his Stinger Launcher. Bond realizes what's happening and drives over a pile of dug up ground, causing the his tanker [[Wikipedia:Ski (driving stunt)|to ski]]. Just then, Perez fires and the Stinger missile zooms just under Bond's skiing truck and hits the other tanker that Bond made to crash. Bond's tanker keeps skiing towards Perez and others, flee, as Bond's tanker returns to balance, crushing the Jeep used by the thugs.\n\nThen Perez and co. rush after Bond's tanker guns blazing, blowing up one of the tires on Bond's tanker. Bond's tanker skids and stops with its fuel container eking out the cliff. Perez and co. approach Bond, who is forced to take cover. Bond is then save when Pam flies over Perez and others, releasing the plane's crop dust over them, momentarily incapacitating them. Bond then sees the other two tankers and releases the container lock, causing it to slide down the hill and impacting one of the tankers, with the collision resulting in a big explosion. \n\nSanchez's Maserati pulls over and its occupants getting out to see the damage. Sanchez is already frustrated with Bond's actions, and when Truman-Lodge starts mouthing Sanchez off, the latter swiftly kills him with a quick Uzi blast. Sanchez orders his other henchman carrying Stinger missiles to accompany him, with Bond seeing this and returns to the truck cab to chase him down.",
    "Bond vs. Sanchez": "Bond's truck leaves as Perez and co. arrive too late to stop it, only for Braun's [[Dodge Ram]] to arrive and the goons boarding it. Sanchez and the other henchman board the remaining tanker with a intact fuel container, while the two collided tanks explode again, creating a wall of fire. Bond's truck arrives to the firewall with the Dodge Ram nearing him. Bond makes the truck do a wheelie and gets over the wall of fire - making it through intact - while Perez and Braun deciding to drive through, with the three other henchmen realizing it to be a bad idea and jump off. The Dodge Ram drives through, catching fire.\n\nBond nears Sanchez's tanker, with Pam arriving in the Super Cub. Sanchez sprays his Uzi at Bond's tanker and runs out of ammo, with Bond then engaging the cruise control to keep the tanker going so that he can leap onto Sanchez's tanker off the own tanker's hood.\n\nSanchez orders the driver to give him the Stinger launcher, while Bond grabs onto the ladder of Sanchez's tanker. Perez and Braun arrive in the Dodge Ram and shoot at Bond, who opens the container's vault to let out some gasoline, which the burning Dodge Ram sets on fire. The fire from the gasoline trail blinds the Dodge Ram, with Perez and Braun driving off a cliff to their deaths.\n\nSanchez spots Pam's Super Cub following them, and gets the Stinger to shoot her down. The Stinger missile blows through the rear tail of Pam's Super Cub, causing her to fly away and land somewhere. Sanchez orders the driver to stop the truck, with Bond jolted into the area between the truck cab and the container. Sanchez attacks with a machete, cutting various lines connected between the truck and container, including the brake fuel, which causes the truck to start moving on its own. Pam lands her plane and gets out, soon spotting the truck that was left on cruise control by Bond.\n\nBond and Sanchez fight at the back of the truck's container, and as the truck nears a crag without the breaks, the driver bails out. The truck veers off a hill and rolls over, with the crash causing a large dust cloud. The fuel container is ruptured, with injured Bond trying to crawl away from it. \n\n[[File:Sanchez's death.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bond setting Sanchez on fire with the lighter gifted by Felix and Della.]]\nAfter a moment, gasoline-soaked Sanchez appears with his machete drawn at Bond's face. Murderous looking Sanchez grabs Bond and throws him at a rock, telling him that Bond \"could have had everything\" while Bond searches his pockets. As Sanchez is about to cleave Bond with his machete, Bond then offers to reveal why he ruined Sanchez and shows the Leiter Lighter that was given to him at the wedding. \n\nBond flicks the lighter and sets gasoline soaked Sanchez on fire. Bond flees as Sanchez - burning alive - stumbles into the wrecked tanker truck's cistern, causing it to explode in a massive fireball. Bond gets out and watches on as the grueling battle to avenge his comrade is finished. Pam arrives in the remaining truck, asking Bond aboard.",
    "Epilogue": "Later, Bond, Bouvier and Q are attending a party at Sanchez's residence. Bond is talking to Felix Leiter - who has regained consciousness after the attack - over the phone, agreeing for a fishing trip the next week. Leiter also tells that M called, saying that he \"has a job\" for Bond and tried to reach him, informing that Bond is reinstated to MI6, but Bond has to end the call when Lupe appears. \n\n[[File:11-311878 0x420.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bond and Pam sharing a romantic moment at the pool.]]\nBond has a chat with Lupe, who has gotten the jewelry off late Sanchez's Iguana. While Q and Pam are talking with each other, Lupe expresses her gratitude to Bond by giving him a kiss. Pam and Q see this, with the former getting upset about it and leaving the floor while tearing up. Bond rebuffs Lupe's offer to stay in Istmus with her, but he excuses himself to go see Pam.\n\nBond sees Pam by the pool below quietly crying. As President Hector Lopez arrives by Lupe, Bond thinks she should form a relationship with \"El Presidente\" instead, and jumps to the pool below. Pam is cheered up from seeing Bond and offers to get him out of the pool, only for Bond to pull her in as well. The two share a passionate kiss as Lopez, Lupe and Q watch over the balcony, before giving them privacy.",

    "Legacy and Reception": "[[File:Sbk09.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Teaser poster.]]\n''Licence to Kill'' didn’t revolutionize the Bond franchise commercially, and at the time its darker take divided audiences. But over the years it has earned a strong legacy as one of the “different” Bond films — admired for its grit, for Dalton’s intense turn, and for nudging the franchise toward a more serious mode -- which would be fully realized later.\n\n===Box-office under-performance===\nTaking inflation into account ''Licence to Kill'' is the least financially successful James Bond film. Since its release many authors, fans, and critics have debated the reasoning for this. More often, ''Licence to Kill'' is blamed for its increase in violence over previous Bond outings. This led to a [[British Board of Film Classification#Certificates|15]] rating in Britain and a [[MPAA film rating system|PG-13]] rating in the United States; the latter having been created in [[1984]] and gone through a major reclassification (along with [[MPAA film rating system|PG]]) in 1989.  The inability of children to legally watch the film in cinemas in the United Kingdom due to its 15 rating severely dented box office returns in one of its key markets.\n\nAnother reason often brought up is Timothy Dalton's dark portrayal of James Bond, although it is often acknowledged that his interpretation is closest to Ian Fleming's secret agent character. Additionally, ''Licence to Kill'' drastically breaks away from the \"Bond formula\" by having 007 become a rogue agent in an attempt to obtain revenge for the near-death of his good friend [[Felix Leiter (David Hedison)|Felix Leiter]]. Due to this change, the film is often seen as having less humour than previous films, most notably [[Roger Moore]]'s Bond films.\n\n[[Albert R. Broccoli]] has openly stated that he disliked the handling of the marketing and promotion for ''Licence to Kill'', which was severely affected by a late title change. The original title for the film, ''Licence Revoked'', had a large amount of promotional material already produced by artist Robert Peak. Peak's promotional work was based on Dalton's portrayal of Bond and was more dramatic and hard-edged in what many consider more akin to the style of artwork for ''Dirty Harry''. The delay in producing corrected materials, this time created by Steven Chorney in a more traditional style, is said to have negatively affected the film especially in the United States. The reasoning for the name change is purported to have been the result of [[test screening]]s shown in the United States where the audience apparently misunderstood the word 'revoked' (supposedly thinking it referred to driving licences). It has been reported that there was some confusion with the British spelling of \"Licen'''c'''e\", which in American English is spelled \"Licen'''s'''e\". It is possible that due to this confusion the film was re-titled for the home video market in the United States with the British spelling, \"''Licence to Kill''\", although some U.S. television networks display the title with its U.S. theatrical title.\n\nThe marketing issues are said to have put a serious dent in the film's potential for box office success in the crucial US market. It was also in competition with several other movies in would prove to be one of the most successful summer blockbuster seasons in film history. Among the films competing with Bond were ''Batman'', ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'', ''Lethal Weapon 2'', ''Honey I Shrunk the Kids'' and ''Ghostbusters II''. As a direct result, ''Licence to Kill'' was the last Bond film, to date, to open in the summer. \n\n===Reception===\n====Initial====\nWhen ''Licence to Kill'' was released, it garnered a mixed-but-leaning-positive reception from critics and audiences. Some critics pointed out that the franchise was moving toward a darker, more personal direction compared to earlier Bond movies. For example, film critic Roger Ebert praised Dalton’s portrayal, describing the character as a “lean tension and a toughness that is possibly more contemporary.” However, some critics and fans found this change in tone — from the more flashy, gadget-filled style of past Bonds to a raw, revenge-driven thriller — which was considered rather jarring and out of place for a Bond film.\n\n====Contemporary====\nOver time the film’s reputation has grown among Bond aficionados and there is increasing appreciation for its distinctiveness within the series. Many commentators see it as a precursor to the much darker, more emotionally driven Bond films that would arrive later (notably in the [[Daniel Craig]] era) — even though those came much later. \n\nWithin lists of all Bond films, it often ranks somewhere in the upper-mid among fan polls for its boldness. Its more violent, personal revenge plot stands out in the series — rather than world-domination by a megalomaniac, Bond is seeking vengeance after an attack on his friend.\n\nBecause Dalton’s run ended after this film (due to various production and legal issues), some speculate on how the series might have developed if this darker tone had been continued. The film’s mix of pulpy action, grim tone, and Bond’s personal vendetta has influenced how future Bond films balance character drama with spectacle.\n\n===Third Dalton Film===\nPre-production work for the third James Bond film starring Dalton, fulfilling his three-film contract, had commenced in May 1990. The ultimately [[Unmade Bond 17 (1991)|unmade 17th Bond film]] that was originally planned for release in [[007 franchise timeline#1991|1991]].\n\nHowever due to legal wranglings over the ownership of the franchise, the series went on a six year hiatus until 1994. During that time, screenwriter [[Richard Maibaum]] had died, and Dalton exercised an option in his contract and resigned before the role was given to [[Pierce Brosnan]] one year before the next Bond film, ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]'' was released.",

The possible loss of an arm is alluded to in the film but not confirmed. The tactic Sanchez uses for smuggling drugs into the United States also comes from ''Live and Let Die''. \n*In some ways the film has close relations and similarities to [[Roger Moore]]'s first gig as Bond, ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'':\n**Both films are set in a fictional country. (''Live and Let Die'' in [[San Monique]], ''Licence to Kill'' in the [[Republic of Isthmus]])\n**Both films feature drug lords as a main villain without global-scale megalomaniacal motives. Instead, their goals are mainly focused on drug distributions on specific areas.\n**Both films feature henchmen characters noted for their sneering grins. (''Live and Let Die'' has [[Tee Hee (Julius Harris)|Tee Hee]] and [[Baron Samedi]] [who was noted for his mocking, rather demonic laugh], while ''Licence to Kill'' has [[Dario]])\n**Both films feature speedboat chases.\n**Both films feature plane chases.\n**Both films feature Bond playing card games against a Bond Girl.\n**Both films feature scenes where Bond's [[Walther PPK|signature firearm]] is being confiscated by the enemies, leaving Bond to opt [[List of Firearms|other sorts of weapon]] during the subsequent phases of his missions. During the climactic battle in ''Live and Let Die'', long after Tee Hee crushes Bond's Walther PPK with his prosthetic hands, he carries a Smith & Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum revolver, which he would later use to kill the [[Dambala|voodoo tribal chief]] at San Monique and destroy a lifelike robotic replica of Baron Samedi. In ''Licence to Kill'', Sanchez persuades Bond to leave his Walther behind on his head office as he promises Isthmus City is a \"safe\" place. Bond would later borrow Pam Bouvier's Beretta to check into his suite after being told that \"your uncle has arrived\", only to comically discover it is Q welcoming him, and this encounter results with Q supplying Bond with a custom-made signature rifle and plastic explosives that would be used the next day to unsuccessfully assassinate Sanchez.\n**Both films feature villain characters killed by physical inflations that lead up to explosions. In ''Live and Let Die'', as a way to conclude the final fight, Bond forces Dr. Kananga to swallow the shark gun pellet whilst being drowned in the shark pool, causing Kananga to blow up like a giant balloon and explodes. In ''Licence to Kill'', Sanchez locks Krest in a decompression chamber, after the former mistakenly believed that Krest had set out an assassination plot against him. Sanchez then gradually increases the pressure on the valves and axes the vent, causing Krest's head to inflate and blow into pieces, killing him.\n**Both films feature sharks in pivotal scenes. In ''Live and Let Die'', the shark is seen at the final battle when both Bond and Kananga plunge down the pool where Bond forces Kananga to swallow a shark pellet, causing him to inflate and explode. In ''Licence to Kill'', Milton Krest's pet shark has mauled both Felix Leiter's legs and Ed Killifer. Also in ''Licence to Kill'', there is an ally character named Sharkey.\n**Both films feature reptiles. In ''Live and Let Die'', a snake is smuggled inside Bond's bungalow only for him to kill it with a flamed aftershave. Later on, Bond is surrounded by alligators in the middle of a small lake and makes his escape by jumping on their backs. At the climax, a coffin of snakes is featured in a portion of the final battle, where the snakes later supposedly \"kill\" Baron Samedi instead of Bond or [[Solitaire (Jane Seymour)|Solitaire]]. In ''Licence to Kill'', Franz Sanchez pets an iguana which was disliked at first by his mistress Lupe Lamora. However, at the end of the story, Lamora is seen as conquering her hatred of the animal, even sporting it with diamond necklaces.\n**David Hedison portrayed Bond's CIA (then transferred to DEA in ''Licence to Kill'') ally and best friend, [[Felix Leiter (David Hedison)|Felix Leiter]], in both films. Leiter's leg maiming scene in ''Licence to Kill'' is inspired by one from the original ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' novel and never occurs on its film adaptation, where Leiter is, instead, shown in a completely healthy and physically unharmed state, saying goodbye to Bond and Solitaire who would depart on a train leaving San Monique.\n**Unlike most of Bond films, [[John Barry]] did not score ''Live and Let Die'' and ''Licence to Kill''.\n\n===Other trivia===\n*[[Tracy Bond (Diana Rigg)|Tracy Bond]] is referenced when Della gives James her garter. (It is stated that it was a long time ago.)\n*The film was due to be shown on ITV in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on March 13, 1996, but was cancelled after the Dunblane Massacre occurred that day.\n*James Bond is never shown in the film wearing a necktie, although he does wear a bow tie for a brief period.\n*The film featured a real, identifiable brand of cigarettes during one key sequence, which led to the studio requiring the addition of the United States Surgeon General warning regarding cigarette smoking to the closing credits. Smoking occurs in many Bond films; however, this is the only film which featured the warning. The cigarette manufacturer in question paid a fee to have its brand featured, which sparked debate over the appropriateness of product placement in motion pictures.\n*The twisting roads in Mexico where the tanker scenes were shot, Rumorosa, were said to be haunted from frequent traffic deaths that had occurred there. The film crew experienced many unexplained accidents and ghostly phenomenon while there, such as trucks driving off by themselves in the night or sightings of ghosts. The final scare came when the still photographer was capturing images of the last tanker explosion. In one picture, a distinct fiery hand is seen coming out of the fireball. The hand was not seen on any of the rushes from the other cameras which further added to its ghastly nature. The making-of documentary on the 1999 DVD talks more about these strange happenings in Mexico.\n*This film was the second of three films to star Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush together as they both starred in the action film, ''Die Hard'', released in 1988 in which they portrayed their roles as FBI agents Johnson and Johnson. Both Davi and Bush had later appeared together in the 1992 slasher film, ''Manic Cop III: Badge of Silence'' with Davi reprising his role as NYPD Detective Lieutenant Sean McKinney from the 1990 film, ''Manic Cop 2'' and Bush portraying the role as a minor character named William. \n*[[Benicio del Toro]] is the second Academy Award-winning actor to play a Bond villain (after [[Christopher Walken]] in ''[[A View to a Kill (film)|A View to a Kill]]''), although did not win his Oscar until 11 years after ''Licence to Kill'' with ''Traffic''.\n*References are made to Ernest Hemingway twice: the use of his home in the Florida Keys and when Bond hands in his resignation, he says \"It's a Farewell to Arms.\"\n*The movie title and the alternate title is said by M when Bond is handing in his resignation: \"Your License to Kill is revoked.\"\n*It is so far the only film to have the main Bond girl ([[Pam Bouvier]]) and the supporting Bond girl ([[Lupe Lamora]]) to survive in the film, appearing in the end.\n*This is the last James Bond film to feature the airline logo \"Pan Am\" as the airline went bankrupt 2 years later. The logo can be seen when Bond is about to check in for a flight behind the receptionist.\n*First James Bond film to show [[Felix Leiter (David Hedison)|Felix Leiter]] being wounded, and the same thing would later occur in ''[[No Time to Die (film)|No Time to Die]]'', where [[Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright)|Leiter]] is shot to death by the cunning CIA operative [[Logan Ash]].\n*This is the first Bond film to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA in North America due its darker and edger tone and for language.\n*This was the last Bond movie to release in the summer. After intense competition that year, all future Bond films since open in either autumn or winter.\n*The last bond film to be released in the 1980's and the last to be released in the two-year chronological odd number gap.\n*Timothy Dalton's final appearance as James Bond.\n*Robert Brown's final appearance as M.\n**This is also the last acting appearance of Robert Brown 14 years before his death on November 11, 2003.\n*John Glen's last Bond film as the Director. \n*Also, this is the last appearance of Caroline Bliss as Miss Moneypenny.\n*The last Bond film where Bond's employer is referred to as the British Secret Service. In 1994, MI6 made its existence public, thus all subsequent films would identify him as an MI6 agent.\n*This is also the last appearance of MI6 Headquarters located in Whitehall before it's relocation in SIS in the next ''Bond'' film, ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]''.\n*This is also the only 1980's Bond film not to feature Sir Frederick Gray or any scenes in M's office.\n*This is also the first Bond film to not have a mission briefing as M scolds Bond for missing his assignment in Instabul, due to Bond's obsession with this private vendetta and his revenge against Sanchez.\n*This is also the only Bond film where Bond does not interact with Miss Moneypenny or feature any scenes in Q Branch, though Q Branch is mentioned by Miss Moneypenny.\n*This is also the last Bond film to have the Gunbarrel sequence and main titles designed by Maurice Binder two years before his death in 1991.",

Both Davi and Bush had later appeared together in the 1992 slasher film, ''Manic Cop III: Badge of Silence'' with Davi reprising his role as NYPD Detective Lieutenant Sean McKinney from the 1990 film, ''Manic Cop 2'' and Bush portraying the role as a minor character named William. \n*[[Benicio del Toro]] is the second Academy Award-winning actor to play a Bond villain (after [[Christopher Walken]] in ''[[A View to a Kill (film)|A View to a Kill]]''), although did not win his Oscar until 11 years after ''Licence to Kill'' with ''Traffic''.\n*References are made to Ernest Hemingway twice: the use of his home in the Florida Keys and when Bond hands in his resignation, he says \"It's a Farewell to Arms.\"\n*The movie title and the alternate title is said by M when Bond is handing in his resignation: \"Your License to Kill is revoked.\"\n*It is so far the only film to have the main Bond girl ([[Pam Bouvier]]) and the supporting Bond girl ([[Lupe Lamora]]) to survive in the film, appearing in the end.\n*This is the last James Bond film to feature the airline logo \"Pan Am\" as the airline went bankrupt 2 years later. The logo can be seen when Bond is about to check in for a flight behind the receptionist.\n*First James Bond film to show [[Felix Leiter (David Hedison)|Felix Leiter]] being wounded, and the same thing would later occur in ''[[No Time to Die (film)|No Time to Die]]'', where [[Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright)|Leiter]] is shot to death by the cunning CIA operative [[Logan Ash]].\n*This is the first Bond film to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA in North America due its darker and edger tone and for language.\n*This was the last Bond movie to release in the summer. After intense competition that year, all future Bond films since open in either autumn or winter.\n*The last bond film to be released in the 1980's and the last to be released in the two-year chronological odd number gap.\n*Timothy Dalton's final appearance as James Bond.\n*Robert Brown's final appearance as M.\n**This is also the last acting appearance of Robert Brown 14 years before his death on November 11, 2003.\n*John Glen's last Bond film as the Director. \n*Also, this is the last appearance of Caroline Bliss as Miss Moneypenny.\n*The last Bond film where Bond's employer is referred to as the British Secret Service. In 1994, MI6 made its existence public, thus all subsequent films would identify him as an MI6 agent.\n*This is also the last appearance of MI6 Headquarters located in Whitehall before it's relocation in SIS in the next ''Bond'' film, ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]''.\n*This is also the only 1980's Bond film not to feature Sir Frederick Gray or any scenes in M's office.\n*This is also the first Bond film to not have a mission briefing as M scolds Bond for missing his assignment in Instabul, due to Bond's obsession with this private vendetta and his revenge against Sanchez.\n*This is also the only Bond film where Bond does not interact with Miss Moneypenny or feature any scenes in Q Branch, though Q Branch is mentioned by Miss Moneypenny.\n*This is also the last Bond film to have the Gunbarrel sequence and main titles designed by Maurice Binder two years before his death in 1991.",
