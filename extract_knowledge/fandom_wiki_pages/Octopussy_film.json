The film is the sixth to star [[Roger Moore]] as the British Secret Service agent, Commander James Bond. It is also the second film Moore has done with Swedish actress [[Maud Adams]], the first being 1974's ''The Man with the Golden Gun''. Produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Michael G. Wilson]], it was released in 1983, the same year as the release of the non-Eon James Bond film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' by screenwriter and ''[[Thunderball]]'' film-rights owner [[Kevin McClory]].\n\nThe film is loosely based upon the Fleming short stories \"[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights#\"Octopussy\"|Octopussy]]\" and \"[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights#\"The Property of a Lady\"|The Property of a Lady]]\", both of which were published in the collection ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]''.",
    "Plot summary": "{{More Images Needed}}\n===Latin America mission===\nThe pre-title sequence involves [[James Bond (Roger Moore)|James Bond]] - aided by a female agent named [[Bianca]] - infiltrating Latin American military officer [[Colonel Toro]]'s supply base and destroying it. Near the base, a horse show is taking place, with Bond arriving under guise of a tournament participant in an [[Land Rover Range Rover Convertible|off-road vehicle]] towing a horse trailer. Bond then meets Bianca and then disguises himself as Colonel Toro.\n\nPosing as Toro, Bond gets inside the base and enters one of the hangars to try plant a explosive inside one of the fighter aircraft's onboard radar. As he does, he gets apprehended and unmasked by Toro, who orders Bond to be taken outside as his men remove the explosive.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki Octopussy Bond avoiding missile.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Bond in the Acrostar UL trying to avoid the homing surface-to-air Missile.]]\nBond was taken away in an army vehicle, but with help of Bianca, who charms the guards accompanying Bond, he escapes capture. The two unload a [[Bede BD-5J|\"Acrostar\" ultralight aircraft]] from the horse carriage, that Bond boards to leave the hot zone. However, as he takes off, Colonel Toro's men spot him and fire a [[Rapier Surface-to-air Missile|homing surface-to-air missile]] that chases Bond inside his aircraft. \n\nBond tries to evade the missile and - after several maneuvers - he manages to lure the missile into the target hangar, causing it to explode and killing Toro and his men. Subsequently, Bond flies away but starts to run low on fuel -- making him land near a friendly gas station, with Bond asking the station attendant to \"fill up\" the plane.\n\n=== Death of 009, Fabergé egg and the rogue Soviet General ===\nIn East Berlin, [[009 (Octopussy)|Agent 009]], disguised as a circus clown, attempts to cross the sector border into West Berlin. The twin knife-throwing artists [[Mischka]] and [[Grischka]] pursue him through a forest. The first twin's knife misses, but the second mortally wounds him, falling in a river. With his last ounce of strength, 009 manages to drag himself to the British Embassy, and crashes through the window and dropping a [[Fabergé Egg|Fabergé egg]], now lying dead on the floor.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki Octopussy Briefing Photo1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Briefing at M's office over the forged Fabergé egg.]]\nBond is called to meet with [[M (Robert Brown)|M]] at the MI6 headquarters in [[London]], with Bond first having a chat with [[Miss Moneypenny]] and her assistant, [[Penelope Smallbone]]. Once inside the office, M briefs Bond about the Fabergé egg that 009 recovered -- informing him that the egg is a forgery. The forgery's actual counterpart is currently being auctioned at Sotheby's auction house, with Bond ordered to go look into the matter, accompanied by an art expert.\n\nMeanwhile in the [[Soviet Union]], during a meeting of the Soviet Armed forces High Command and CPSU General Presidium, Soviet [[General Orlov]] tries to rattle other members for a more aggressive policy, claiming his troops in East Germany could invade western Europe in 5 days. The moderate fraction under [[General Gogol]] opposes to this plan in part due to their fear of an nuclear retaliation as well as their preference for peaceful co-existence with the West.\n\nOrlov gets a call and after the meeting goes to Soviet Art Depository, where his underling - [[Lenkin]] - informs that Mischka and Grischka failed to recover the forged Fabergé egg. Orlov calms Lenkin, telling he has a comrade in London that will handle the recovery of the original.\n\n=== The Property of a Lady ===\nBond and the art expert go the Sotheby's auction, where they spot [[Kamal Khan]] - an exiled [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] prince and illicit art dealer - accompanied by a woman ([[Magda]]), which they deem a curious presence. \n\nAs expected, the real Fabergé egg gets presented to be auctioned, with Bond, declaring himself as one of the bidders, using the chance of viewing it, to discreetly exchange it for the forged egg. He then engages in a bidding war with Khan, with the latter paying £500,000 for the (now replica) egg, signifying Khan's desperation of getting it back.\n\nBack at M's office, M is furious with Bond about his involvement in the auction, until Bond reveals the trade he made. M then sends 007 to [[Udaipur]], [[India]], to spy on Kamal Khan and find out why he paid such a sum.\n\n=== Finding Kamal Khan ===\nBond travels to India, staying at a posh hotel. After provoking Khan by exposing his cheating during a game of Backgammon and offering the egg he'd taken as \"security\".  Bond and local agent [[Vijay]] escape [[Gobinda]] and Khan's henchmen in a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw tuk-tuk] chase to meet [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]]. Q places a small tracer in the egg that will function with Bond's wristwatch. Bond later encounters [[Magda]], Khan's beautiful companion; after making love, Magda leaves with the egg and Bond is knocked out and taken to Khan's palace by Gobinda.\n\nKamal Khan is involved in smuggling the fake jewellery with help from the mysterious [[Octopussy (Maud Adams)|Octopussy]], a fabulously wealthy woman who lives in a luxurious island palace, dubbed the \"Floating Palace\", in India, surrounded by women who are members of her [[Octopus Cult]], each recognized by a tattooed blue-ringed octopus on their bodies. Octopussy is more than a smuggler, however, and has many legitimate businesses, including shipping, hotels, carnivals and circuses - the latter being used as an ideal front for smuggling jewelry.\n\nBond discovers a secret meeting between Khan and General Orlov at the former's palace. Orlov is supplying Khan with real, priceless Soviet treasures, replacing them in state depositories with replicas to fund a yet unknown operation. 007 overhears them planning to meet at [[wikipedia:Chemnitz|Karl-Marx-Stadt]] in East Germany, where Octopussy's [[Octopussy's International Circus|circus]] is going to perform before it heads on a train to the West. Bond manages to escape from the palace, but is chased by Khan in style of an Indian big-game hunting through the jungle, and is saved by some passing American tourists.\n\n===Confronting Octopussy===\nBond finds Octopussy and confronts her, only to find out that she feels indebted to him: When Bond was sent after her [[Dexter Smythe (Lew Hooper)|father]], a traitorous British Major, for smuggling and murder years before, he let him commit suicide rather than face the shame of a court martial. Octopussy declares Bond her ally in front of Khan, and the two make love in the evening. The following night, they defend her palace against unknown assailants; during the brawl Bond fakes his death and departs to Karl-Marx-Stadt, having discovered that Octopussy's circus will perform there the next day. He also finds Vijay killed by the same assailants, hired by Khan.  Meanwhile, back in Moscow, the counterfeit jewels are discovered in the Kremlin Art Depository by General Gogol and curator [[Borchoi]], prompting the arrest of Orlov's accomplice [[Lenkin]]  - prompting Gogol to also go to East Germany in pursuit of Orlov.\n\n=== Defusing a bomb ===\nIn East Germany Bond sneaks into Octopussy's circus to discover Orlov's and Khan's real plan - to replace the smuggled jewellery canister with a [[Atomic Bomb]]. The warhead is primed to go off during a performance at a US Air Force base in West Germany. As the explosion will look like an accident, Europe would insist on nuclear disarmament and thus leave western Europe defenceless against an attack from Orlov's Soviet forces.\n\nBond tries to stop the train with the bomb on board from leaving the Soviet base. He confronts Orlov, but is interrupted by Soviet soldiers. Orlov and Bond both race to catch the train, with Bond unknowingly taking [[Mercedes-Benz 280 S (W108)|the General's car with the jewelry]]. Orlov lets his soldiers pursue Bond's car, which drives with its wheel rims on the rails after the tires have been punctured. Just after 007 has managed to jump onto the train, the car crashes into a river, where it is soon found by General Gogol. [[File:OrlovDies.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Orlov dies after being shot by border guards]]\nFinally Orlov also catches up with the circus train. However, while trying to jump onto it, he is gunned down by border guards, as he has forcibly crossed the border between East and West Germany. Gogol, having found out about Orlov's involvement in the smuggle, arrives just as Orlov is shot. As Gogol calls him \"a common thief and a disgrace to the uniform\", the dying Orlov is confident that \"tomorrow, [he] shall be a hero of the Soviet Union\", leaving Gogol to realise there is more to this scheme than just contraband.\n[[File:Octopussy_-_Bond_defuses_the_nuke.jpg|thumb|260px|Bond attempts to defuse the bomb.]]\nAboard the train, Bond is discovered and pursued by Kamal Khan and his henchmen. Bond is forced off, then follows the train in a stolen car, pursued by the police. Khan and Gobinda leave, on their way out passing Bond on the road, but Khan thinks they will be \"rid of Bond too\". As Bond has trouble getting into the American military base and the circus, he disguises himself as a clown. The American generals at the performance don't believe his warnings due to his costume. After 007 shows Octopussy the most expensive piece of the stolen jewelry, the ''Romanov Star'', which he has taken from the canister earlier, he convinces her of Khan's betrayal. In the ensuing brawl Bond discovers the bomb with Octopussy's help, and manages to defuse it just in time.\n\n===Showdown with Khan===\nBack in India, Kamal Khan is preparing to abandon his palace. However, Octopussy and her [[Octopus Cult|cult members]] arrive, along with [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]] and Bond in a hot air balloon in a Union Jack pattern. Showing their prowess in hand-to-hand combat, overpower the guards using their circus tricks, although Kamal escapes on a light plane with Octopussy. Bond hangs onto the plane, and after a deadly fight with Gobinda on top of it, he and Octopussy manage to escape. The plane crashes into the side of a mountain, killing Kamal.\n\n===Aftermath===\nGogol has a meeting with M telling him that the USSR will deny the incident ever occurred. However, he suggests Bond should return the ''Romanov Star''. M agrees, but informs Golgol that 007 is on medical leave. During medical leave on Octopussy's boat, Bond surprises Octopussy by having none of the assumed injuries, and the two make love.",

    "Production": "The movie takes it title from the [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[Octopussy_and_The_Living_Daylights#\"Octopussy\"|short story ''Octopussy'']] - which is often compiled in a book together another short story relevant to the movie, ''[[Octopussy_and_The_Living_Daylights#\"The_Property_of_a_Lady\"|The Property of a Lady]]'' (with other two being [[The Living Daylights]] and [[007 in New York]].) As with lot of the prior Bond movies, the film has very little in common with the short story -- with only a part of the short story's plot being alluded through a conversation between Bond and Octopussy. ''The Property of a Lady ''short story is also relevant to the film's plot, as it is source to the \"Fabergé egg auction\" central to the plot.\n\nOctopussy would be the first Bond film produced under the MGM banner, which merged with the original Bond production company, United Artists, in 1982. However, EON Productions would soon find itself faced with a peculiar challenge, as [[Kevin McClory]]'s unofficial James Bond movie (''[[Never Say Never Again]]'') was finally getting off the ground, and with the original James Bond actor [[Sean Connery]] as its lead. This stand-off between two major James Bond would become to be known as the \"[[Battle of the Bonds]]\"\n\n===Writing===\n====Blofeld plot (September 3, 1981)====\n[[File:Bondwiki OHMSS69 Lazenby in Dark promo picture.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ideas for Octopussy's plot date all the way to George Lazenby's unmade 2nd Bond film, which was meant to be a sequel to On Her Majesty's Secret Service.]]\n\nThe original draft dated September 3, 1981 was conceived by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson, which detailed a plot with James Bond going after the mysterious figure known as Octopussy, a powerful woman with a criminal empire who defies [[SPECTRE]]’s leader, [[Blofeld]]. Enraged, Blofeld plots revenge, setting the stage for conflict between the two. The plot bears semblance to the original plot of the 1971 ''[[Diamonds are Forever (film)|Diamonds are Forever]]'', when it was meant to be sequel to ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' with [[George Lazenby]] still attached to the project.\n\nPlot proper kicks of in London, when Bond is introduced to a female model nicknamed “Jay Jay” at a casino and later at an art auction involving a suspiciously overpriced antique mug. Bond would then travel to Japan in pursuit of Jay Jay, where he discovers Blofeld's part in a counterfeiting plot. \n\nBond would be framed and arrested for corruption, but then escapes with Q’s discreet help and tracks the counterfeit network to India. There, he discovers Octopussy’s floating palace and her organization of female operatives. Realizing she has been manipulated by Blofeld, Bond persuades her to join him against SPECTRE.\n\nThe climax unfolds aboard a train filled with counterfeit plates and explosives. Bond battles Blofeld’s men and destroys the operation, killing Blofeld in the process. In the end, Octopussy disappears mysteriously, leaving Bond victorious but uncertain of her fate.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20241227125228/https://www.commander007.net/wp-content/EcrireBond/Scripting%20007%20-%20Cl%C3%A9ment%20Feutry.pdf \"Scripting 007: Behind the writing of the James Bond movies\" by Clement Feutry (Version 2.2 - Nov 30, 2024)] - Chapter 13: \"Octopussy\" (pages 779-787)</ref>\n\n====NATO-Soviet conflict plot (September 30, 1981)====\nThe September 30th 1981 draft opens at a NATO firing range in the Netherlands, where a new anti-tank rocket is being tested. Among the observers are James Bond and Swedish NATO intelligence officer Greta Nesvig. When two suspicious men are identified, they flee toward a NATO airship. Bond pursues them, climbing onto the airship’s mooring cable and fighting one suspect atop the craft. After ejecting him, Bond smashes through the cockpit window, defeats the second man, and lands the airship—ending the pre-title action sequence with characteristic flair.\n\nAt NATO headquarters in Belgium, Supreme Allied Commander Boswell oversees a simulation of European conflict alongside strategist '''Leslie Fathom''' (envisioned as Orson Wells-like figure), a brilliant but eccentric figure who soon departs for London. Meanwhile, in Moscow, '''General Anatol Bulgakov''' (essentially a prototype of [[General Orlov]] in the final film) and his aide Levski worry that NATO’s new rocket threatens Soviet military plans. They conclude that any invasion of Western Europe must occur before these weapons are fully deployed.\n\n[[File:Zorin's Blimp.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Airship fight sequence similar to one later used in ''A View to a Kill'' was originally considered in one of the early drafts for ''Octopussy''.]]\nDuring the mission, Bond would have run-ins with a female assassin nicknamed Octopussy (with [[Grace Jones]] being envisioned for the role - likey serving as prototype for [[May Day]]). Bond’s mission deepens when he learns that Fathom, now suspected of double dealings, may be manipulating both NATO and the Soviets. \n\nTraveling between Brussels, London, and Eastern Europe, Bond uncovers a plot involving stolen military technology, falsified intelligence, and a plan to destabilize Europe through deception and sabotage. In a tense finale involving a stolen airship (with the sequence pre-dating [[John Gardner]]'s ''[[Role of Honour]]'' and EON's ''A View to a Kill'') and a race against time, Bond thwarts Fathom’s attempt to ignite a war between East and West.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20241227125228/https://www.commander007.net/wp-content/EcrireBond/Scripting%20007%20-%20Cl%C3%A9ment%20Feutry.pdf \"Scripting 007: Behind the writing of the James Bond movies\" by Clement Feutry (Version 2.2 - Nov 30, 2024)] - Chapter 13: \"Octopussy\" (pages 788-795)</ref>\n\n====Enter George MacDonald Fraser====\nThe plot was heavily revised then in 1982 when [[George MacDonald Fraser]] was brought in. In addition, to being informed of a scandal in the Soviet Union, which involved General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev's son-in-law having helped the Moscow State Circus to smuggle jewellery.\n\nFraser, noted for his extensive knowledge of British colonial history and India, was recruited by producer Michael Wilson and director John Glen to enhance the narrative’s cultural authenticity and humor, as the film’s primary setting was to be India.\n\nFraser’s drafts - from around December 1981 to May 1982 - diverged significantly from the final cinematic version. His proposed pre-title sequence took place on the Isle of Man during the Tourist Trophy motorcycle race, featuring James Bond engaged in a lethal sidecar duel—a concept that foregrounded kinetic spectacle and visual irony. \n\n[[File:Louis Jourdan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Kamal Khan and the yo-yo saw weapon were Fraser's contributions to the movie's plot.]]\nThe main narrative introduced the return of Blofeld, who sought to infiltrate and commandeer Octopussy’s organization in India for heroin trafficking. Concurrently, the British intelligence service became destabilized when M was assassinated under suspicious circumstances, a plot element that implicitly reflected the real-life death of actor Bernard Lee.\n\nFraser’s narrative situated Bond as both fugitive and investigator: framed for M’s murder by his new superior, Villiers—later revealed to be aligned with Blofeld—Bond was forced to evade his own agency while uncovering the conspiracy against him.

His original contract required him to appear in three films, which he fulfilled with ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''. He agreed to doing ''Moonraker'' in 1979, which he planned to be his last, only reluctantly agreeing into doing ''For Your Eyes Only'' after EON was unable to find a new Bond actor. For the role of James Bond, several actors were approached to portray the famous spy, including Oliver Tobias, Lewis Collins, Michael Billington, and James Brolin. Of these, Brolin was seriously considered the role.\n\nHowever, the complications rising from McClory's ''Never Say Never Again'' put the producers on a tough spot, as they feared Sean Connery's star power of potentially trouncing an new, untested Bond actor. Last minute decision was made to let Brolin go, with the producers approaching Moore, since he was the only one with star power to withstand Connery toe-to-toe. Ultimately, Moore was persuaded to play the lead role in Octopussy, from which Moore received $4 million plus a percentage of the box office takings.\n\n====Other cast====\nActresses Faye Dunaway, Persis Khambatta, or Sybil Danning were originally considered for the role of [[Octopussy (Maud Adams)|Octopussy]] before it was given to [[Maud Adams]]. Maud Adams was playing her second Bond film after ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun]]''.\n\n[[Robert Brown]], who played [[Admiral Hargeaves]] in ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', appears in the role of [[M (Robert Brown)|\"M\"]] for the first time since [[Bernard Lee]]'s death. He had already co-starred with Roger Moore in the television series ''Ivanhoe'' in the late 1950s.\n\n[[Michaela Clavell]] played to role of [[Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell)|Miss Moneypenny]]'s assistant - [[Penelope Smallbone]] - presumably to take over [[Lois Maxwell]]'s role once she quits and act as a Moneypenny-like role for the younger Bond actor/Roger Moore's successor. However, since Moore was made to come back, Smallbone would not return in subsequent films, with [[Caroline Bliss]] taking such role as the [[Miss Moneypenny (Caroline Bliss)|new Miss Moneypenny]] during [[Timothy Dalton]]'s James Bond tenure.\n\nBond's Indian contact, [[Vijay]], is played by [[Vijay Amritraj]], a very popular tennis pro at the time. As an allusion to this, he wields a tennis racket in the taxi chase scene. Since he was not a member of the actors' union, they wanted to prevent him from being used. They finally agreed to split the role between two characters. The newly created character is [[Sadruddin]], played by [[Albert Moses]].\n\nProducer [[Michael G. Wilson]] makes two cameo appearances. Once he appears as a passenger on the Indian tourist boat, another time as a Russian general at the Soviet security conference. [[Tracy Llewelyn]], the daughter of [[Q]] actor [[Desmond Llewelyn]], plays one of Octopussy's dancers.",

Bond pursues them, climbing onto the airship’s mooring cable and fighting one suspect atop the craft. After ejecting him, Bond smashes through the cockpit window, defeats the second man, and lands the airship—ending the pre-title action sequence with characteristic flair.\n\nAt NATO headquarters in Belgium, Supreme Allied Commander Boswell oversees a simulation of European conflict alongside strategist '''Leslie Fathom''' (envisioned as Orson Wells-like figure), a brilliant but eccentric figure who soon departs for London. Meanwhile, in Moscow, '''General Anatol Bulgakov''' (essentially a prototype of [[General Orlov]] in the final film) and his aide Levski worry that NATO’s new rocket threatens Soviet military plans.

    " Comic book adaptation ": "A magazine format [[comic book]] adaptation of ''Octopussy'' was produced in 1983 by [[Marvel Comics]] as the 26nd issue of their 'Marvel Comics Super Special' series, which had previously adapted ''For Your Eyes Only'' in issue 19. The adaptation was written by [[Steve Moore (writer)|Steve Moore]] and illustrated by [[Paul Neary]]. In Europe, a completely different comic book version was published, written by [[Jack Sutter]] and illustrated by [[Frederico Maidagan]]. In this version, M is drawn to resemble [[Bernard Lee]] whereas in the Marvel Comics version he looks like [[Robert Brown]].",
    " Legacy ": "The legacy of the ''Octopussy'' is multifaceted and reflects its place in both the Bond franchise and the broader landscape of 1980s action cinema. While not universally regarded as one of the best Bond films, it remains significant for several reasons.\n\n''Octopussy'' is considered \"peak Roger Moore-era Bond\" - being arguably the ultimate representative of Moore's more lighthearted, exaggerated style of his Bond films. The mixture of glamour, clever gadgets, and over-the-top humor with Cold War espionage, which matched Moore's personality: charming, stylish, and fun-loving. It helped solidify his place in Bond history, though some critics thought the humor was too exaggerated and not taken seriously enough.\n\nIndeed, movie critics were beginning to comment on Roger Moore's age, as he was 54 years old at the time of filming, and many felt he was too old to play James Bond. He originally announced that he would retire, but returned one final time in 1985's ''[[A View to a Kill (film)|A View to a Kill]]''.\n\nOctopussy came out in the same year as ''Never Say Never Again'', which starred the original James Bond Sean Connery - resulting in a marketing competition known as \"Battle of the Bonds\". Even though Connery's movie was a big deal, Octopussy did better at the box office. This showed that EON Productions, the company that makes the official Bond movies, still had the most control over the franchise.\n\nThe film was highlighted for its exotic settings and spectacle. The movie stands out because of its rich Indian setting, which brought a fresh and vibrant look to the series. The Indian locations gave the film a special feel, but some parts were criticized for using old-fashioned stereotypes. The action scenes, like the circus train, the airplane climax, and the scene where a clown disguise is used to defuse a bomb, are considered some of the best parts of the Bond movies. However, some people think these scenes go a bit too far.\n\nThe character of Octopussy, portrayed by Maud Adams, is one of the more strong-willed and skilled female characters in Bond movies up to that point. She runs a smuggling operation involving women, which was a forward-thinking idea, but some critics say she wasn't given enough screen time and was often overshadowed by James Bond himself.\n\n''Octopussy'' influenced future Bond films by reinforcing a formula of exotic locales, outlandish villains, and high-stakes spectacle, while also highlighting the danger of excessive camp. This movie signaled the start of Roger Moore's time as Bond coming to an end — he would appear one more time in ''A View to a Kill'' in 1985 before leaving the role.",
    " Trivia ": "* The [[Fabergé egg]] which is stolen was made in 1898 and is entitled 'Lilies of the Valley', although its name not mentioned in the film. The egg contains a model of the imperial state coach.\n* At the end of the film, the credits announce that the next Bond film title as ''From a View to a Kill''. This was later changed to ''A View to a Kill'' right before filming began. ''Octopussy'' is also the last Bond film to date to announce the title of the next film in the end credits, likely as EON had almost run out of source material by Ian Fleming.\n* This is the second Bond movie to feature Maud Adams. The producers were reluctant to feature her again because her previous character was killed in ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''. She also returned back in ''A View to a Kill''. By this Maud Adams is the only actress that portrays a Bond Girl that can be seen in 3 movies.\n* This is also the first movie to feature Robert Brown as M. It is unknown as to whether Brown is supposed to be playing the same character as [[Bernard Lee]] (Sir Miles Messervy) or a different one (possibly a promoted Admiral Hargreaves from ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''), as the films did not establish until ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]'' that 'M' is a title, something which Ian Fleming left ambiguous in the novels.\n* The pre-title sequence was originally to take place in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (along with the concept of twin knife-throwing assassins) over the [[Angel Falls]], but this was shelved after the river-bed dried up.\n* [[Vijay Amritraj]] was a professional tennis player in real life. The movie makes a spoof of this fact by having Vijay fend off Kamal's henchmen with a tennis racquet, while the surrounding townspeople watch the conflict like a tennis match by repeatedly turning their heads left then right. At one point Vijay's character also jokes that he plays a little tennis.\n* [[Gary Russell]], who plays one of the East Berlin teenagers in the car, was uncredited for his role.\n* Octopussy's palace is really the [http://www.tajhotels.com/Palace/TAJ%20LAKE%20PALACE,UDAIPUR/default.htm Lake Palace Hotel] in [[Udaipur]].\n* The film marks the first time Q joins Bond in the field mission as well as aiding him in the climactic battle against the main villain's side. During the ensuing fight between members of [[Octopussy's International Circus|Octopussy's Circus]] and the armed guards of the Monsoon Palace, Bond and Q arrives at the scene with a Union Jack hot-air ballon equipped with surveillance TV that captures [[Kamal Khan]] and [[Gobinda]]'s abduction of [[Octopussy (Maud Adams)|Octopussy]]. Bond jumps off the balloon to immediately pursue the trio, while Q continues to land the balloon where it knocks down a guard who points his weapon at [[Magda]] and some of the women from the [[Octopus Cult]]. As a token of gratitude to Q for the accidental help, Magda and the women surround the elderly quartermaster and give him kisses in the cheek, much to Q's visible delight.\n* The locomotive used for the Octopussy circus is a former Danish States-railways Class S 740, returned to Denmark in the 1990s. This was the only time the train in question was taken out for out use during its time in the UK.\n* [[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]] was one of two Eon productions, the other being Octopussy, to be released in the same year as a [[Battle of the Bonds|rival Bond film]]. [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]] was the other offering. While both films turned a healthy profit, Casino Royale was accused of lowering the takings of You Only Live Twice. Ironically, on the second occasion this happened, in 1983, [[Sean Connery|Connery]] was in the lead role for the rival Bond film, [[Never Say Never Again (film)|Never Say Never Again]].\n* The ''Saint Michael’s Castle'' used to double for [[St. Petersburg Military Archives]] in ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]'' is actually very close to the [[Wikipedia:Shuvalov Palace|Shuvalov Palace]], which hosts the Fabergé Museum and the Fabergé egg featured in ''Octopussy''.",
