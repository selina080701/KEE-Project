Oh yes, The Man With The Golden Gun.|[[M (Bernard Lee)|M]] and [[James Bond (Roger Moore)|James Bond]]|The Man with the Golden Gun}}\n'''''The Man with the Golden Gun''''' is a 1974 spy film, and the ninth official ''James Bond'' film, as well as the second to star [[Roger Moore]] as British Secret Service agent Commander [[James Bond (Roger Moore)|James Bond]]. ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was made by [[EON Productions]] and is a loose adaptation of [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|1965 novel of the same name]]. The film was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] and was the final Bond film to be co-produced by Saltzman as his partnership with Broccoli dissolved after the film's release. Saltzman's 50% stake in EON Productions parent company, Danjaq, was then purchased by [[United Artists]]. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' for three years in 1977. The interval would be the longest break in the series until the six-year hiatuses between ''[[Licence to Kill (film)|Licence to Kill]]'' in 1989 and ''[[GoldenEye (film)|GoldenEye]]'' in 1995, and again between ''[[Spectre (film)|Spectre]]'' in 2015 and ''[[No Time to Die (film)|No Time to Die]]'' in 2021.",
    "Plot summary": "An American gangster, [[Rodney]], visits famed and notorious sharpshooter hitman [[Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee)|Francisco Scaramanga]] (who charges $1 million) to kill him and collect a bounty at the hands of his assistant, [[Nick Nack (Hervé Villechaize)|Nick Nack]], but he is directed into a funhouse section of the estate. Despite attempting to move through corners, Rodney is easily shot by Scaramanga using his [[Golden Gun|deadly single-shot gold-plated pistol]] named the Golden Gun, which is capable of always killing a target with only one bullet.\n\nIn [[London]], a golden bullet etched with \"007\" ([[James Bond (Roger Moore)|James Bond]]'s codename) into its surface, is mailed to Her Majesty's Secret Service, the [[MI6|Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6). It is believed by Military Intelligence that Scaramanga has been hired to assassinate James Bond and has sent the bullet to intimidate his new target. Because no one knows of his appearance outside of having a third nipple, [[M (Bernard Lee)|M]] (Bond's 'control' officer in MI6) relieves Bond of his current mission involving tracking an energy scientist named [[Gibson]].\n\n[[File:TMWTGG - Bond and Anders drink to their new partnership.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Bond meeting [[Andrea Anders]].]]\nNow officially \"on leave\" from his duties, Bond sets out to find Scaramanga before the assassin finds him. After gaining information from [[Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell)|Miss Moneypenny]], 007 travels to [[Beirut]]. By retrieving a golden bullet from the belly button of a [[Saida|belly dancer]] which was used to assassinate [[Bill Fairbanks|another 'Double-0 agent']] sometime previously, Bond is led to [[Lazar]], the man responsible for supplying Scaramanga with his unusual golden ammunition in Macau, and then [[Andrea Anders]], Scaramanga's mistress. \n\nAt her Peninsula Hotel room, he coerces her to expose information about Scaramanga, his appearance and his plans. She directs Bond to the [[Bottoms Up Club]] where Scaramanga snipes Gibson when he steps outside, and Nick Nack steals a small device called the [[Solex Agitator]] off his body. Bond, who had pulled out his [[Walther PPK|pistol]] outside the club, is arrested by Hong Kong police lieutenant [[Hip]]. Instead of going to the station, he is transported to the wreck of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Queen_Elizabeth RMS ''Queen Elizabeth''] in the harbor where he meets M and [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]], and is assigned to work with Hip to retrieve the Solex.\n\nBond next travels to [[Bangkok]] to meet [[Hai Fat]], a wealthy Thai entrepreneur suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Posing as Scaramanga by showing off his [[Prosthetic Nipple|fake third nipple]], Bond is invited to dinner, but his plan backfires because unbeknownst to him, Scaramanga himself is operating inside Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured and placed inside Hai Fat's martial arts academy, where the students duel to the death and then are instructed to kill him. Escaping with the aid of Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorized sampan along the river, and reunites with his assistant, [[Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland)|Mary Goodnight]]. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat with his Golden Gun and assumes complete control of his empire and the Solex.\n\nAnders later meets Bond and confesses that it was she who sent the golden bullet to MI6; to lure 007 to kill Scaramanga for her, and promises to give him the Solex as they spent the night together. At a Muay Thai boxing event the next day, Bond finds Anders sitting and staring silently, dead from a bullet (as she was actually shot by Scarmanga). Scaramanga suddenly arrives and casually introduces himself to Bond, but Bond is able to smuggle the Solex to Hip, who passes it to Goodnight. When Goodnight follows Nick Nack to place a homing device on Scaramanga's car, the assassin instead traps her in the car's boot. \n\nBond discovers Scaramanga driving off and steals an [[AMC Hornet]] from a showroom to give chase, coincidentally with the holidaying [[J.W. Pepper]] (the Louisianan sheriff Bond encountered in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'') sitting inside, and even did a stunt of jumping over a broken bridge in a spiral. The chase concludes when Scaramanga's [[AMC Matador Coupé]] hides in a building and then transforms into a plane that flies off.\n\n[[File:TMWTGG - Bond dines with Scaramanga and Goodnight.jpg|thumb|308x308px|[[Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee)|Scaramanga]], [[Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland)|Goodnight]] and Bond having dinner.]]\nTracking Goodnight's homing beacon, Bond takes a seaplane and flies to Scaramanga's [[Scaramanga's Island|island]] in the [[China|Red Chinese]] waters. Scaramanga welcomes and shows Bond the solar power plant facility that he has taken over, a technology for which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. While demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses the solar-powered energy beam to destroy Bond's plane, preventing him from escaping. During lunch, Scaramanga proposes a pistol duel with Bond on the beach after the two engage in a classy argument that resulted in the professional assassin pulling his Golden Gun out faster than the spy could with his Walther PPK (but mercifully refuses to kill 007). \n\nWith Nick Nack officiating, the two men take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's manor and funhouse section. Despite the villain's skills rivaling the 00 Agent, Bond, however, eventually outwits and ultimately kills Scaramanga by wisely posing as his mannequin replica and shooting into his heart with a single shot while he is off-guard. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief, [[Kra]], but the latter's fall into a liquid helium vat causes the plant's temperature to spiral out of control. \n\nBond retrieves the Solex unit just before the plant is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's Chinese junk. After Bond fends off one final attack by a vengeful Nick Nack, he romances with Goodnight, completing his deadly mission of defeating arguably the most dangerous man alive.",
    "Development": "[[File:Man-with-the-golden-gun_concept_poster.jpg|thumb|250px|Concept poster art. Based on [[James Bond (George Lazenby)|George Lazenby]]]]\n[[EON]] producers [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] originally intended ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' to follow the 1967's ''[[You Only Live Twice]]'', but production was cancelled, because it was to have been filmed in [[Cambodia]], the ongoing Vietnam War in the region made filming impractical. [[Roger Moore]] had been invited to be Bond in the 1969 version, but was unable to take to role, as he still had obligations to ''The Saint'' TV series. Instead, EON Productions pursued ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', with [[George Lazenby]] cast as [[Sean Connery]]'s first successor for the Bond role.\n\nEven before the release of 1973's ''[[Live and Let Die]]'', United Artists had already greenlit another James Bond film after viewing rushes for the film. Although ''Live and Let Die'' turned out to be a big success - out-grossing ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'', which starred the original Bond actor [[Sean Connery]] - the production of ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was not as favorable as its predecessor's.\n\nThe production for the ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' faced several production challenges, including creative differences, financial troubles for producer Harry Saltzman, and issues with the script and the overall tone.<ref>[https://screenrant.com/james-bond-movies-man-golden-gun-bad/ ScreenRant - The Man With The Golden Gun Almost Ended James Bond Movies]</ref>\n\nIndeed, during the production, Saltzman faced variety of personal and financial difficulties, leading to him selling his share of the Bond franchise. This ultimately led to the separation of the Broccoli-Saltzman partnership that had been a cornerstone of the Bond films up to that point.\n\n===Writing===\n[[Tom Mankiewicz]] - who had written the prior two Bond movies - was tasked to submit a script for the project by late 1973. Although he had written a few drafts for the film, he felt that he could no longer delivered the best material he could and left the project. With Mankiewicz's exit, Broccoli called series veteran [[Richard Maibaum]] to rework Mankiewicz drafts into something filmable.\n\nThere were quite severe creative differences between screenwriter Richard Maibaum and director Guy Hamilton during the writing and pre-production stages.\n\n===Filming===\nThe scenes featuring the island hideout of Scaramanga were filmed in [[Phang Nga]] province in [[Thailand]], north of the city of [[Phuket]]. One of the islands seen in the film is known as the \"Nail\" island (or Ko Khao Tapoo) &mdash; in the film, this island houses the solar panels. Scaramanga's hideout is actually Ko Kow-Phing-Khan &mdash; both islands are now tourists attractions.",

    "Legacy": "First debuting in December of 1974, ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' is considered one of the more \"troubled\" installments of the series. Although the movie has its fans - primarily thanks to [[Christopher Lee]]'s striking villain - it is generally regarded as one of the lesser movies in the James Bond movie pantheon. The cause of its critical and financial disappointment is usually pointed towards the troubled production, which resulted in a flawed end product and a disorganized marketing campaign.\n\nMade with $7 million, same as the preceding ''Live and Let Die'', ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' ended up grossing $97.6 million at the box-office, compared to the preceding move's $161.8 million -- there being a roughly 40% decrease in box-office profits. According to Lee Pfeiffer and Dave Worrall's book \"[[The Essential Bond]]\", the movie's promotional campaign was \"one of the more anaemic\" ones in the film series' history.\n\n===Points of contention===\nAlthough James Bond series is continually criticized for its sexist and misogynistic content, ''The Man With the Golden Gun'' tends to be considered the most flagrant example in the series, with instances that go overboard even by the series' usual standards. Notably, James Bond's assistant, Mary Goodnight, portrayed as a stereotypical blonde buffoon who is nearly useless to him. On the other hand, when Bond is fleeing an enemy dojo, chased by martial artists, he offers to protect two girls who were being menaced by them, only to have them demonstrate their superior fighting skill by easily thrashing Bond's pursuers.\n\nAdditionally, [[Roger Moore]]'s portrayal of James Bond in this film has been scrutinized, as Moore's Bond acts uncharacteristically aggressive in this film (a portrayal closer to [[Sean Connery]]'s Bond) despite being more of a \"gentleman spy\" in the rest of his movies -- including in the preceding movie ''Live and Let Die''.",

    "Trivia": "===Similarities with You Only Live Twice===\nThe film still shares notable similarities with ''You Only Live Twice'' - with this movie originally planned to follow that movie, instead of 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service. These include:\n* Both films are loosely adapted from original novels by [[Ian Fleming]] which were published posthumously, with the main storylines and villains' plots differ greatly from the original iterations.\n* Both films feature predominantly Asian locales as the setting, with portions of some scenes being set in [[Hong Kong]]. ''You Only Live Twice'' is mainly set in Japan; [[James Bond (Sean Connery)|Bond]] is dispatched there to eventually locate [[Blofeld (classic film continuity)|Blofeld]] and [[SPECTRE]]'s involvement in the space race issue after faking his own assassination in Hong Kong as depicted in the pre-title sequence. ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' departs from its original Carribean setting and features Bond tracking down Scaramanga from Beirut to Macau, Hong Kong, and eventually to Thailand in order to prevent Scaramanga from using the stolen Solex Agitator for personal gains; during his stint in Hong Kong he witnessed the murder of Solex's scientist Gibson by Scaramanga and then later MI6 contact Lt. Hip escorted him into MI6 headquarters, covered by the shipwreck of RMS Queen Elizabeth, for a briefing with his superiors including M.\n* Due to the films being mainly set in Asia, both feature notable martial arts scenes.\n* There are entrepreneur characters, each working as an associate for the main villains in both films (''You Only Live Twice'' has [[Osato]] working for Blofeld, while ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' has Hai Fat working for Scaramanga). Osato and Hai Fat would later end up being shot dead by their respective superiors.\n* In these two films, Bond had arranged appointment in a fighting tournament with female allies who would later be killed during the progress of his missions. In ''You Only Live Twice'', he encountered [[Aki]] for the first time in a sumo wrestling match, and Aki would later be poisoned to death by a [[Bedroom Assassin|ninja assassin]] in league with SPECTRE during Bond's incognito job at the ninja academy in preparation of his raid to [[Volcano Lair|the SPECTRE hideout]]. In ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', Scaramanga's mistress Andrea Anders was supposed to deliver Bond the stolen Solex at a Thai kick boxing match, when Bond discovered she was already shot dead by Scaramanga.\n* Both films feature seclusive island that holds the main villain's hideout. In ''You Only Live Twice'', SPECTRE's base of operations is uncovered beneath a \"lake\" inside an extinct Japanese volcano which would be raided by Bond and a squat of Japanese SIS ninja operatives to its eventual destruction. In ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', Scaramanga's \"funhouse\" is secluded beneath the rocks of Khao Phing Kan island and would later be destroyed after Bond managed to retrieve the Solex and upset the reactors volatile.\n* MI6 headquarters are being shown inside a vessel in both films. ''You Only Live Twice'' features scene where [[Royal Navy]] frogmen retrieves Bond's \"corpse\" and bring him inside a Royal Navy submarine fleeting beneath the waters of Hong Kong. Bond soon awakes from his apparent \"death\" for an audience with M. After escaping from a supposed custody in ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', Bond jumps into the shipwreck of RMS ''Queen Elizabeth'' and is greeted by a Royal Navy officer, who then takes him into M's office.\n\n===Other trivia===\n*The film refers the then-recent [[Wikipedia:1973_oil_crisis|1973 oil crisis]]. Britain had not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released, and North Sea oil was not as well exploited as today.\n*The \"nail\" island seen in the film is known by locals as James Bond Island in all tourist literature. The site was extremely hard hit by a tsunami following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Originally, Ha Long Bay off the coast of Vietnam was considered but the effects following the Vietnam War - the Phang Nga filming location was revisited again in 1997 for [[Tomorrow Never Dies (film)|''Tomorrow Never Dies'']] substituting for Ha Long Bay. Today, it is famously known as [https://www.phuket101.net/james-bond-island/ James Bond Island].\n*[[Christopher Lee]], Ian Fleming's step-cousin, was Fleming's choice for the role of [[Dr. Julius No (Joseph Wiseman)|Dr. Julius No]] in the film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. According to Bond film historians, Lee also was considered for the role of James Bond.\n*The [[Bottoms Up Club]] (the bar where Gibson, the man who created the Solex meets Lt. Hip, MI6's main agent in Hong Kong) is actually a real bar that was still open well after the film's release until it eventually closed down in 2009. It even has a notice on its sign that it was featured in this movie.\n*Like the main antagonist Francisco Scaramanga himself, his [[Golden Gun]] quickly proved popular enough in the fanbase of the film as well as the ''James Bond'' community as a whole that it became featured in various [[James Bond Video Games|''James Bond'' video games]], including ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 game)|GoldenEye 007]]'', as a rare, suitably incredibly powerful weapon. In every game except for [[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|one case]], the Golden Gun counts as an instant kill, reflecting that Scaramanga never missed. The golden weapon is also found in different media as well.\n*Although her performance in the film is undistinguished, Mary Goodnight is a recurring character in several of Ian Fleming's ''Bond'' novels, even appearing in lieu of [[Miss Moneypenny]]; in the books, Goodnight is Bond's secretary.\n*The famous cork-screwing car jump was first demonstrated on January 12, 1972 at the American Thrill Show which was held in Houston, Texas in the Astrodome where Jay Milligan drove an AMC Javelin. Cubby Broccoli contacted Milligan where he entered into negotiations - the producers took out copyrights and patents on the stunt in order to prevent it being used before they could integrate to a ''James Bond'' film; the jump was planned using computer modeling based on research at Cornell University on rollover collisions for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Stuntman Bumps Willard drove the AMC Hornet (modified by Milligan's stunt team with a center mounted steering wheel and powered with an AMC 258 (4.2L) inline six engine bolted to a Chrysler Torqueflite 904 transmission for reduced weight) when he performed the stunt with a center mounted steering wheel, and it was done in only one take during filming. Milligan also drove another similar looking AMC Hornet where he did perform the driving stunts in Bangkok including the J-turn (later known as a Rockford as seen in the TV series The Rockford Files) in one scene.\n*[[Marc Lawrence]], who plays a gangster called Rodney who was shot dead by Scaramanga at the start of the film, played a similar character in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever]]'', although this film does not indicate whether Lawrence is playing the same character.\n*The title sequence features the dancing of Carolyn Cheshire, later to be a renowned bodybuilder.\n*While filming, Roger Moore used to tease Christopher Lee about his iconic role in ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula_(1958_film) Dracula]'' (1958). Also, one time when they were filming on the island, Lee accidentally went into a cave and ironically startled a swarm of bats that flew out of the cave.\n*Of all the films in the franchise so far, this movie sports the smallest kill count for Bond, just one, being Scaramanga himself.\n*Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland also starred together around the same time in the cult Scottish horror film ''The Wicker Man'' (1973).

The next film to be released in an even-numbered year is [[Die Another Day (film)|''Die Another Day'']], which was released 28 years after this film in 2002.\n*The film was released during the height of the Martial Arts and Kung Fu film craze of that was coming out of Hong Kong and Asia during the 1970s.",
    "Similarities with You Only Live Twice": "The film still shares notable similarities with ''You Only Live Twice'' - with this movie originally planned to follow that movie, instead of 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service. These include:\n* Both films are loosely adapted from original novels by [[Ian Fleming]] which were published posthumously, with the main storylines and villains' plots differ greatly from the original iterations.\n* Both films feature predominantly Asian locales as the setting, with portions of some scenes being set in [[Hong Kong]]. ''You Only Live Twice'' is mainly set in Japan; [[James Bond (Sean Connery)|Bond]] is dispatched there to eventually locate [[Blofeld (classic film continuity)|Blofeld]] and [[SPECTRE]]'s involvement in the space race issue after faking his own assassination in Hong Kong as depicted in the pre-title sequence. ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' departs from its original Carribean setting and features Bond tracking down Scaramanga from Beirut to Macau, Hong Kong, and eventually to Thailand in order to prevent Scaramanga from using the stolen Solex Agitator for personal gains; during his stint in Hong Kong he witnessed the murder of Solex's scientist Gibson by Scaramanga and then later MI6 contact Lt. Hip escorted him into MI6 headquarters, covered by the shipwreck of RMS Queen Elizabeth, for a briefing with his superiors including M.\n* Due to the films being mainly set in Asia, both feature notable martial arts scenes.\n* There are entrepreneur characters, each working as an associate for the main villains in both films (''You Only Live Twice'' has [[Osato]] working for Blofeld, while ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' has Hai Fat working for Scaramanga). Osato and Hai Fat would later end up being shot dead by their respective superiors.\n* In these two films, Bond had arranged appointment in a fighting tournament with female allies who would later be killed during the progress of his missions. In ''You Only Live Twice'', he encountered [[Aki]] for the first time in a sumo wrestling match, and Aki would later be poisoned to death by a [[Bedroom Assassin|ninja assassin]] in league with SPECTRE during Bond's incognito job at the ninja academy in preparation of his raid to [[Volcano Lair|the SPECTRE hideout]]. In ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', Scaramanga's mistress Andrea Anders was supposed to deliver Bond the stolen Solex at a Thai kick boxing match, when Bond discovered she was already shot dead by Scaramanga.\n* Both films feature seclusive island that holds the main villain's hideout. In ''You Only Live Twice'', SPECTRE's base of operations is uncovered beneath a \"lake\" inside an extinct Japanese volcano which would be raided by Bond and a squat of Japanese SIS ninja operatives to its eventual destruction. In ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', Scaramanga's \"funhouse\" is secluded beneath the rocks of Khao Phing Kan island and would later be destroyed after Bond managed to retrieve the Solex and upset the reactors volatile.\n* MI6 headquarters are being shown inside a vessel in both films. ''You Only Live Twice'' features scene where [[Royal Navy]] frogmen retrieves Bond's \"corpse\" and bring him inside a Royal Navy submarine fleeting beneath the waters of Hong Kong. Bond soon awakes from his apparent \"death\" for an audience with M. After escaping from a supposed custody in ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', Bond jumps into the shipwreck of RMS ''Queen Elizabeth'' and is greeted by a Royal Navy officer, who then takes him into M's office.",
    "Other trivia": "*The film refers the then-recent [[Wikipedia:1973_oil_crisis|1973 oil crisis]]. Britain had not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released, and North Sea oil was not as well exploited as today.\n*The \"nail\" island seen in the film is known by locals as James Bond Island in all tourist literature. The site was extremely hard hit by a tsunami following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Originally, Ha Long Bay off the coast of Vietnam was considered but the effects following the Vietnam War - the Phang Nga filming location was revisited again in 1997 for [[Tomorrow Never Dies (film)|''Tomorrow Never Dies'']] substituting for Ha Long Bay. Today, it is famously known as [https://www.phuket101.net/james-bond-island/ James Bond Island].\n*[[Christopher Lee]], Ian Fleming's step-cousin, was Fleming's choice for the role of [[Dr. Julius No (Joseph Wiseman)|Dr. Julius No]] in the film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. According to Bond film historians, Lee also was considered for the role of James Bond.\n*The [[Bottoms Up Club]] (the bar where Gibson, the man who created the Solex meets Lt. Hip, MI6's main agent in Hong Kong) is actually a real bar that was still open well after the film's release until it eventually closed down in 2009. It even has a notice on its sign that it was featured in this movie.\n*Like the main antagonist Francisco Scaramanga himself, his [[Golden Gun]] quickly proved popular enough in the fanbase of the film as well as the ''James Bond'' community as a whole that it became featured in various [[James Bond Video Games|''James Bond'' video games]], including ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 game)|GoldenEye 007]]'', as a rare, suitably incredibly powerful weapon. In every game except for [[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|one case]], the Golden Gun counts as an instant kill, reflecting that Scaramanga never missed. The golden weapon is also found in different media as well.\n*Although her performance in the film is undistinguished, Mary Goodnight is a recurring character in several of Ian Fleming's ''Bond'' novels, even appearing in lieu of [[Miss Moneypenny]]; in the books, Goodnight is Bond's secretary.\n*The famous cork-screwing car jump was first demonstrated on January 12, 1972 at the American Thrill Show which was held in Houston, Texas in the Astrodome where Jay Milligan drove an AMC Javelin. Cubby Broccoli contacted Milligan where he entered into negotiations - the producers took out copyrights and patents on the stunt in order to prevent it being used before they could integrate to a ''James Bond'' film; the jump was planned using computer modeling based on research at Cornell University on rollover collisions for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Stuntman Bumps Willard drove the AMC Hornet (modified by Milligan's stunt team with a center mounted steering wheel and powered with an AMC 258 (4.2L) inline six engine bolted to a Chrysler Torqueflite 904 transmission for reduced weight) when he performed the stunt with a center mounted steering wheel, and it was done in only one take during filming. Milligan also drove another similar looking AMC Hornet where he did perform the driving stunts in Bangkok including the J-turn (later known as a Rockford as seen in the TV series The Rockford Files) in one scene.\n*[[Marc Lawrence]], who plays a gangster called Rodney who was shot dead by Scaramanga at the start of the film, played a similar character in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever]]'', although this film does not indicate whether Lawrence is playing the same character.\n*The title sequence features the dancing of Carolyn Cheshire, later to be a renowned bodybuilder.\n*While filming, Roger Moore used to tease Christopher Lee about his iconic role in ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula_(1958_film) Dracula]'' (1958).
