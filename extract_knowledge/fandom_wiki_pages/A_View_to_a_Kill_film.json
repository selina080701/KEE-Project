It is also the final Bond film to have [[Lois Maxwell]] as [[Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell)|Miss Moneypenny]], which had began with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. It was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Michael G. Wilson]]. Wilson also co-authored the screenplay along with veteran screenwriter [[Richard Maibaum]].\n\nThe title itself is adapted from [[Ian Fleming]]'s short story \"[[For Your Eyes Only#\"From A View to a Kill\"|From A View to a Kill]]\", contained in the ''[[For Your Eyes Only]]'' collection of short stories released in [[007 franchise timeline#1960|1960]]; however the title is where the similarity between short story and the film end, making this the second completely original Bond film after ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''. At the end of ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'' during the famed \"James Bond Will Return\" sequence, it listed the next film as \"From A View to a Kill\", the name of the original short story; however, the title was later changed a few months before filming for unknown reasons (possibly to conform with Duran Duran's theme song). The original title \"From A View to a Kill\" was taken from a version of the words to a traditional hunting song \"[[Wikipedia:John Peel (farmer)|D'ye ken John Peel?]]\": \"From a find to a check, from a check to a view,/From a view to a kill in the morning\".",
    "Plot summary": "{{More Images Needed}}\n===Opening===\n[[File:Bondwiki VTAK85 BondSnowboard.png|thumb|right|250px|Snowboarding James Bond defeating Soviet troops.]]\n[[James Bond (Roger Moore)|James Bond]] is sent to [[Siberia]], where he finds [[003 (A View to a Kill)|003]] buried by an avalanche and recovers a microchip from the corpse. With the help of field agent [[Kimberley Jones]], he escapes the ambushing [[Soviet]] troops. Back in [[England]], [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]] informs [[M (Robert Brown)|M]], Bond and the [[Fredrick Gray|Minister of Defence]] that the retrieved microchip's design is an exact match of an advanced microchip resistant to electro-magnetic pulse damage manufactured by [[Zorin Industries]], indicating the company is leaking top secret technology to the Soviets.\n\n===Max Zorin and his miracle horse===\nAlong with [[Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell)|Miss Moneypenny]], the group then venture to the Ascot Racecourse to observe the company's owner, Frenchman [[Max Zorin]]. Zorin's horse, Pegasus, miraculously wins the race; [[Sir Godfrey Tibbett]], a horse trainer, believes the horse was using drugs, but the screening prior to the race came back negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with [[Achille Aubergine]], a local detective already investigating the accusations. During dinner at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is killed by Zorin's lover and henchwoman [[May Day]], but not before Bond learns about Zorin's annual horse sale in a few weeks. The futile chase after May Day leaves Bond with 6 million in damages and a citizen's arrest on him, infuriating the minister.\n\nBond and Tibbett later travel to Zorin's stud in [[Wikipedia:Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly, France]] where Bond poses as St. John Smythe, a stuffy horse dealer. Zorin hosts a elegant party a day before he will auction off his latest brood. At the party, Bond spies on Zorin's office and sees him writing a check to a beautiful woman. Bond sneaks into the office and finds Zorin's checkbook, making a copy of the check he'd written, made out to an \"S. Sutton\" for $5 million. Bond later talks to Zorin, complementing him on his lavish stables. He also takes a subtle jab at the method May Day used to kill Aubergine in Paris. \n\nBond and Tibbett locate and break into Zorin's secret labs where they discover that Zorin is using implanted microchips to release the drug remotely, triggered by a switch in his cane. In another room they find an assembly line packing up large amounts of the pulse-resistant microchips, enough to supply the world. Bond and Tibbett are forced to fight off two of Zorin's thugs and they slip out. Back at the mansion, Bond hides in May Day's room to cover his snooping.  However, he and Tibbett are soon discovered and the latter is killed by May Day. Bond survives a deadly horse race but is knocked unconscious. Zorin and May Day attempt to drown him inside his [[Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud II|car]] in a lake but Bond survives underwater by breathing air from one of the car's tires. \n\nZorin is later paid a visit by Gogol, who expresses his dissatisfaction with Zorin's (who was revealed to be a former KGB operative) unauthorized dispatching of Bond. Despite his secret dealings with Moscow and providing them with the pulse-resistant microchips, he no longer considers himself one of their operatives. When one of Gogol's men insults Zorin, calling him a \"physiological freak\", May Day seizes the man and tosses him aside, leaving him in a daze. Gogol gravely tells Zorin that nobody is allowed to simply leave the KGB. \n\n===San Francisco===\nIn [[Skyship 6000|his blimp]] over San Francisco, Zorin unveils his plan to destroy [[Silicon Valley]] in an operation he dubs \"[[Operations and Projects|Main Strike]]\" in order to gain complete control of the microchip market. When one of Zorin's potential partners refuses to participate, due to Zorin's outrageous fee of $100 million and half his country's net income, Zorin dismisses him from the meeting and has May Day drop him out of the blimp into San Francisco bay. \n\nBond learns from [[Chuck Lee]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative, that Zorin is a psychopath as a result of failed steroid experiments by Nazi-turned-Soviet scientist [[Dr. Mortner|Dr. Carl Mortner]], a validation of the insult dealt to Zorin by Gogol's adjutant back in France. While investigating one of Zorin's water pumping plants, Bond later runs into rival spy and former lover [[Pola Ivanova]], who tries to sabotage Zorin on Gogol's orders. The bomb placed by Ivanova's comrade is discovered. Her accomplice is ordered to disarm it and is unceremoniously dumped into one of the pump shafts where he's killed by the pumping fan. \n\nDuring his investigations about Zorin's ventures, Bond meets again with [[Stacey Sutton]], the woman he'd seen at Zorin's estate and the recipient of the check he'd written for her. Zorin sends two thugs to Stacey's house to frighten her into compliance but Bond, having snuck into her home, fights them all off and they flee. Bond talks to Stacey and finds out she is the inheritor of her grandfather's oil company, one that Zorin is determined to buy from her. Spurned by Zorin's new threat, she resolves not to take the deal. As a state geologist, she has a relationship with the mayor of San Francisco but he fires her under pressure from Zorin. When Stacey and Bond try to access records at City Hall later that night, Zorin catches them and turns them over to the mayor. Zorin murders the mayor, trying to frame them both. He traps them in an elevator car and sets fire to it and the building. Bond and Stacey escape; when the police want to arrest them both, Bond steals a hook-and-ladder truck and they flee the city, throwing off their police pursuit.\n\nBond and Stacey travel to Zorin's alleged silicon mine south of the city and unveil Zorin's \"Main Strike\": He plans to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the Hayward Fault and the San Andreas Fault causing them to flood. A bigger bomb in an abandoned mine will destroy a \"geological lock\" that prevents the two faults from moving at the same time. The timed detonations would cause a massive double earthquake, thus destroying Silicon Valley, the world's leading microchip manufacturing area, leaving Zorin the world's chief chip supplier. \n\n===Foiling Main Strike===\nBond and Stacey reach the mine, but Zorin soon begins to flood it with the first set of explosives. May Day, who'd been sent into the mine to find Bond and Stacey, is caught up in the flooding of the mine and left for dead. Feeling betrayed after being left behind to die in the mine, May Day aids Bond in removing the bigger bomb that would destroy the lock. They place it on a hand-cranked rail car and try to send it out of the mine. May Day rides it out, holding onto the faulty brake handle. As it sails out of the mine, Zorin sees it explode with May Day aboard, thwarting his plan.\n\nIn the finale, Stacey is knabbed by Zorin and taken up in his blimp. Bond grabs a rope attached to Zorin's airship as he leaves the mine. During the flight Bond ties the rope to the support cables of the Golden Gate Bridge. Zorin and Bond then fight upon the bridge resulting in Zorin falling to his death into the San Francisco Bay. Mortner, seeking revenge, lights a bundle of dynamite and is about to kill Bond, when Bond cuts the blimp loose. Mortner is killed when he drops the explosive and it blows, destroying the blimp.\n\nBond is awarded with the [[Wikipedia:Order_of_Lenin|Order of Lenin]] by Gogol, who amusingly claims the Soviet economy needs Silicon Valley. Bond is missing in action, but Q's [[Snooper|espionage robot]] finds him and Stacey together in her shower.",

    "Production": "It was planned that two stuntmen, B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would both parachute off the top of the Eiffel Tower so that two takes of the scene could be filmed. However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told he would not be performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.\n\nThe parachute jump from the top of the Eiffel Tower was made from a platform which extended from the edge of the tower. The platform is clearly visible in the film.",

    "Reception and legacy": "''A View To A Kill'''s legacy is somewhat complex, being a mix of box-office success, critical disappointment, and enduring pop-cultural quirks.\n\nWhen released, the movie was a commercial success, though not the highest-grossing Bond film of its era. It actually performed better in the U.S. than its predecessor, ''[[Octopussy|Octopussy]]''. However, it got mixed to negative reviews, not only from movie critics, but even from long-time Bond fans.\n\nThe film marked the end of the Roger Moore era, paving the way for a darker, more realistic Bond under [[Timothy Dalton]] starting with 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights (film)|The Living Daylights]]''.\n\n''A View To A Kill'' is seen today as a flawed but entertaining swan song for Moore. Its frequently cited as one of the weaker Bond entries, yet beloved by some fans for its campy charm and 1980s style, retaining cult appeal among 1980s Bond fans. Referenced in pop culture for its blend of high camp and excess.\n\n===Praise===\nDespite being highlighted for its various problems, the movie has its strong points as well. [[A View to a Kill (song)|“A View to a Kill”]] by [[Duran Duran]] remains one of the franchise’s most iconic songs. Reached #1 on the ''U.S. Billboard Hot 100'', the only Bond theme ever to do so, with its success helping to bring younger audiences to the film.\n\nThe villains were well-received; with [[Christopher Walken]]’s performance as the psychopathic villain Max Zorin and [[Grace Jones]] as the striking and unconventional Bond henchwoman May Day being considered the film's highlight.\n\nAlthough Moore's age hampered some of the believability of the action sequences, the said sequences were still grand and impressive for its time. The fire engine chase in San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge action sequences are regarded as some of the most memorable in the cinematic James Bond pantheon.\n\n===Criticism===\n====Tonal inconsistency====\n[[File:A View to a Kill - Zorin guns down his workers.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Max Zorin's massacre of his own mine workers is regarded as one of the notable tonal whiplashes in the movie that already flip-flops between light and dark.]]\nThe tone of the film was viewed as uneven — campy humor clashing with violent scenes. The film often jumps between light, almost cartoonish comedy and surprisingly brutal or dark violence, without much tonal consistency. This creates a kind of whiplash — scenes that should feel dangerous or serious are undermined by silly humor, and vice versa.\n\nRoger Moore's version of Bond was well-known for being humorous and a bit over-the-top, portraying Bond as clever, witty, and calm, often delivering quick jokes right after action scenes or dispatching his foes. The film includes intentionally silly scenes, such as Bond snowboarding while the Beach Boys' \"California Girls\" plays in the background feeling almost like a parody. His romantic interactions with much younger women are treated in lighthearted fashion -- though they sometimes came across as awkward because of Moore's age.\n\nIn sharp contrast, Max Zorin, portrayed by Walken, is one of the cruelest villains in the entire cinematic Bond history. During a mine scene, he brutally guns down all of his own workers without hesitation, shooting them while clearly enjoying it. His actions show genuine brutality, not just campy menace — more like the kind of villain you'd see in today's Bond movies rather than the fun bad guys from earlier Moore-era films. Walken delivers the role with deep intensity instead of comedy, adding a serious and unsettling tone to his scenes.\n\nThere are a few scenes that seem too intense for a Roger Moore-era Bond movie, like May Day's violent approach to killing people, the aforementioned mine massacre, and the final fight on the Golden Gate Bridge, which is more serious than fun. These moments feel more like they fit in the darker, tougher movies that came after Moore, not in the more lighthearted ones he was known for.\n\n====Roger Moore's age====\n[[File:MooreBondShootingFlare4.png|thumb|right|250px|Roger Moore's advanced age is generally considered to have hurt the believability of the movie's action scenes.]]\n{{Quote|Moore isn’t just long in the tooth — he’s got tusks, and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie-eyed blankness of a zombie. He’s not believable anymore in the action sequences, even less so in the romantic scenes … it’s like watching women fall all over Gabby Hayes.|Film critic Paul Attanasio criticizing Moore's age in his review of the movie.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/05/24/as-bond-moore-is-less</ref>}}\n\nOne common criticism centering on the age of Roger Moore; who was 57 when the movie was completed. Even as of 2025, Moore remains the  oldest actor ever to play James Bond in an official EON Productions film. Critics and audiences alike often remarked that he looked too old for the part, particularly for the physical action sequences and the romantic subplots with much younger women -- for example, Tanya Roberts, who was in her late 20s at the time. Moore himself later acknowledged this criticism. In interviews, he said he felt he was “about 400 years too old for the part” and admitted that ''A View to a Kill'' was the point where he knew it was time to step down as Bond.<ref>https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/a-view-to-a-kill-the-final-roger-moore-james-bond-movie/</ref>\n\n====Goldfinger re-ash====\nThe plotline was criticized for being almost identical to that of ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''; similar elements include:\n*In ''Goldfinger'', the villain's scheme is to irradiate the entire US gold reserve, making it worthless, causing financial meltdown in the West plus [[Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe)|Auric Goldfinger]]'s personal gold stocks will increase in value tenfold; correspondingly in ''A View To A Kill'', Max Zorin intends to destroy Silicon Valley by triggering a massive earthquake, thus leaving his company with a monopoly on the microchip market.\n*As in ''Goldfinger'', one of the business partners in the scam gets cold feet and would rather take the money and run. While [[Mr. Solo (Martin Benson)|Mr. Solo]] was assassinated by [[Oddjob (Harold Sakata)|Oddjob]] and his body disposed of in a car crusher, in ''A View To A Kill'', the dissenter in the ranks is dropped from Zorin's airship and into [[San Francisco]] Bay.\n*Both Zorin and Goldfinger are being bankrolled by the Communists: in the former case, Zorin is an ex-KGB agent, while the atom bomb intended to destroy [[Fort Knox]] is supplied by the Chinese. In Zorin's case, he no longer feels any need to do the bidding of the KGB.\n\n====Similarity with 1978 Superman====\nAnother comparison ''A View to a Kill'' has received is to the 1978 film ''Superman''. Like Zorin, the Superman villain Lex Luthor aimed to destroy California using hijacked nuclear missiles, detonating them in the San Andreas Fault and causing massive earthquakes, which would cause a chain reaction causing the western part of California to fall into the ocean. Also like Zorin, Lex Luthor would stand a gain a monopoly, in this case real estate. Prior to the scam Luthor had purchased acres of desert land for pennies, whose value would multiply astronomically as Luthor's \"New California\". Both films were produced by Pinewood Studios, with the Eiffel Tower scene being on the same stage used in the 1980 sequel film ''Superman II'' where Superman saves Paris from a terrorist group who planted a bomb in the elevator of the Eiffel Tower.\n\n===Opinions of the film's creative===\nMoore himself has stated he considers ''A View To A Kill'' to be his least favorite Bond movie; stating he felt too old for the part, found some of the cast difficult to work with; mostly [[Grace Jones]], and he objected to the increased violence in the movie; especially the scene where Zorin machine guns his employees in the flooding mines.",

His actions show genuine brutality, not just campy menace — more like the kind of villain you'd see in today's Bond movies rather than the fun bad guys from earlier Moore-era films. Walken delivers the role with deep intensity instead of comedy, adding a serious and unsettling tone to his scenes.\n\nThere are a few scenes that seem too intense for a Roger Moore-era Bond movie, like May Day's violent approach to killing people, the aforementioned mine massacre, and the final fight on the Golden Gate Bridge, which is more serious than fun.

Like Zorin, the Superman villain Lex Luthor aimed to destroy California using hijacked nuclear missiles, detonating them in the San Andreas Fault and causing massive earthquakes, which would cause a chain reaction causing the western part of California to fall into the ocean. Also like Zorin, Lex Luthor would stand a gain a monopoly, in this case real estate. Prior to the scam Luthor had purchased acres of desert land for pennies, whose value would multiply astronomically as Luthor's \"New California\". Both films were produced by Pinewood Studios, with the Eiffel Tower scene being on the same stage used in the 1980 sequel film ''Superman II'' where Superman saves Paris from a terrorist group who planted a bomb in the elevator of the Eiffel Tower.",
    "Tonal inconsistency": "[[File:A View to a Kill - Zorin guns down his workers.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Max Zorin's massacre of his own mine workers is regarded as one of the notable tonal whiplashes in the movie that already flip-flops between light and dark.]]\nThe tone of the film was viewed as uneven — campy humor clashing with violent scenes. The film often jumps between light, almost cartoonish comedy and surprisingly brutal or dark violence, without much tonal consistency. This creates a kind of whiplash — scenes that should feel dangerous or serious are undermined by silly humor, and vice versa.\n\nRoger Moore's version of Bond was well-known for being humorous and a bit over-the-top, portraying Bond as clever, witty, and calm, often delivering quick jokes right after action scenes or dispatching his foes. The film includes intentionally silly scenes, such as Bond snowboarding while the Beach Boys' \"California Girls\" plays in the background feeling almost like a parody.

    "Opinions of the film's creative": "Moore himself has stated he considers ''A View To A Kill'' to be his least favorite Bond movie; stating he felt too old for the part, found some of the cast difficult to work with; mostly [[Grace Jones]], and he objected to the increased violence in the movie; especially the scene where Zorin machine guns his employees in the flooding mines.",
    "Trivia": "*The Ascot race segment of the film has similarities to a portion of the [[John Gardner]] Bond novel, ''[[Licence Renewed]]''. If intentional this would be the first time elements of a non-Fleming Bond novel had been utilized for a film.\n*This film is not only Roger Moore's swansong, but [[Lois Maxwell]]'s as well.\n*Leftover canisters of gasoline used during filming of Ridley Scott's ''Legend'' caused [[Pinewood Studios]]' \"007 Stage\" to be burnt to the ground in 1984. Albert R. Broccoli, the producer of the James Bond films had the studio rebuilt in 4 months time so that filming could commence on ''A View to a Kill''. The soundstage was renamed \"[[Albert R. Broccoli's 007 Stage]]\".\n* Christopher Walken was the first Academy Award-winning actor to portray a Bond [[List of James Bond villains|villain]]. [[Javier Bardem]] was the second with his role in ''[[Skyfall (film)|Skyfall]]''. [[Benicio del Toro]], who played lead henchman [[Dario]] in ''[[Licence to Kill (film)|Licence to Kill]]'', has also won an acting Oscar, although he did not win it until 2000, 11 years after his appearance in a Bond film. [[Halle Berry]] also won an Oscar prior to the filming of ''[[Die Another Day (film)|Die Another Day]]''.\n*The [[A View to a Kill (song)|title song]] was performed by Duran Duran. According to the band, they received the part to sing the song after the lead guitarist drunkenly asked [[Albert R. Broccoli]] when will he get someone good to perform a Bond song.\n*David Bowie was the producers' first choice to play Zorin. He turned it down saying, \"I didn't want to spend five months watching my stunt double fall off cliffs.\" The role was then offered to Sting, who also turned it down.\n*When a company with a name similar to Zorin was discovered in the United States, a disclaimer was added to the start of the film affirming that the evil Zorin was not related to any real-life company. This is the only Bond film to have a disclaimer at the start of the film (''Licence to Kill'' had a disclaimer in the end credits about the dangers of smoking).\n*Part of the film takes place on the [[Eiffel Tower]]. In an earlier Bond film, ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', it was mentioned that the tower was purchased by the villain of that movie, [[Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale)|Hugo Drax]], but he was refused an export permit for the structure.\n*It has been suggested that the film's teaser sequence helped initiate interest in snowboarding.\n*The [[Rolls-Royce]] driven by [[Patrick Macnee]] in the film belonged to producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]].\n*First James Bond film to feature no hotel scenes.\n*Though Patrick Macnee plays only a small part in the film, he received his own \"starring\" credit, that is, his name is the only name to appear on screen at the time.\n*In the mine scene towards the end of the film, [[Grace Jones]]' screams when sparks fly around her are genuine. The sparks were created to mimic the effect of electrical cables in and near the water, but Jones was not told about them.\n*At the conclusion of the end credits it says the traditional \"James Bond will return\" but not the title of the next film as had been tradition since ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'', nor has the title of the next film been announced in the end credits of every Bond film since.\n*This film was [[wikipedia:Dolph Lundgren|Dolph Lundgren]]'s film debut. At the time of filming, [[Grace Jones]] was dating Dolph Lundgren. He was visiting her on set one day when an extra was missing, so the director [[John Glen]] asked him if he wanted to get a shot at it. Lundgren appears as a KGB agent during the confrontation between General Gogol and Max Zorin at the racetrack, standing several steps below Gogol.\n*''A View to a Kill'' is the first official James Bond film to not directly use the title of a story by [[Ian Fleming]], and currently the only one to use a modified version thereof.",
