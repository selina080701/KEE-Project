Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]]. The film stars [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond (Sean Connery)|James Bond]] in the actor's sixth and final official film appearance as the spy. Connery would later portray Bond again for the seventh and final time in the unofficial Bond film ''[[Never Say Never Again (film)|Never Say Never Again]]'' 12 years later in 1983, and lend his voice for the character in the 2005 [[video game]] adaptation of ''[[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]''.",
    "Synopsis": "After having seemingly killed his arch-nemesis [[Blofeld (classic film continuity)|Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] for good, [[James Bond (Sean Connery)|James Bond]] is tasked by [[MI6]] to investigate a sudden disappearance of South African [[diamonds]], with the perpetrator apparently hoarding them for unknown purpose. \n\nInfiltrating a diamond smuggling ring through the beautiful [[Tiffany Case (Jill St. John)|Tiffany Case]], Bond's investigation leads him to [[Las Vegas]], with shady undertakings occurring at [[Willard Whyte]]'s businesses. Eventually, Bond comes to learn that not only has Blofeld survived, he has used the diamonds and Whyte's businesses to create a [[Diamond Satellite|laser satellite]], which he intends to use to bring world superpowers to their knees.\n\nRelatively little of [[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|the original 1956 novel]] survives the adaptation to film, though many characters from the original book, plus the idea of Tiffany Case being a diamond smuggler, are retained, so it isn't a complete \"rewrite\".",
    "Plot summary": "{{Cleanup}}\n===Hunt for Blofeld===\n[[File:Creating Blofeld's duplicates (Diamonds are Forever).png|thumb|left|250px|Blofeld entering the surgeons' room.]]\nThe movie begins with [[James Bond (Sean Connery)|James Bond]] in a global pursuit of the [[Blofeld (classic film continuity)|Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] - head of [[SPECTRE]] - (presumably over murder of [[Tracy Bond (Diana Rigg)|Tracy Bond]]), violently extracting information from his contacts in Japan and Cairo, until being lead to an associate named [[Marie]]. \n\nThen, at a secret underground lair, a team of surgeons is going over the details of a plastic surgery operation, that is to be performed on Blofeld. The villain himself soon enters hastily, demanding that the medical operation is to be completed by night. The doctors demand patience, but Blofeld orders them to comply with his schedule.\n\nThe surgeons began the operation, first placing the subject in a bath of mud and covering their face with it. They leave the operating room, with another surgeon heading in, whom to the other surgeon tells to keep the bath's temperature stable. Unbeknownst to them, the actual surgeon is knocked out in the bushes, with James Bond having taken his identity to get close to Blofeld.\n\nWith everybody out - with just him and Blofeld - Bond pulls off the surgeon's mask and begins inspecting the room, thinking that the person in the bath is incapacitated. However, the person in the bath is conscious, and start to slowly drawing a revolver towards Bond. Bond notices just in time and rolls towards the man in the bath (forcing him rise up, since he can't aim at Bond), with 007 pulling a cord that causes the tank above the man to pour mud over the man, forcing him under and drowning him.\n\nBond goes by the mud bath, acquiring pressure washer to clean the mud over the patient. However, to Bond's dismay, the patient wasn't Blofeld, but an random gunman. Blofeld then appears - accompanied by two armed guards - and tells that the man dead in the mud bath was to have plastic surgery in order to become Blofeld's body double, had Bond not interfered. \n\nBlofeld orders one of the guards to disarm Bond, but when he reaches inside the sleeve of Bond's suit, he sets off the [[Pocket Snap Trap]] and injures himself. Bond then grabs the man and the second guard reaches closer and Bond overpowers the two. Bond gets near Blofeld, who orders the guard to get up and kill him, only for Bond to grab surgical scalpels and throw them at the guard, killing him.\n\nBlofeld grabs a [[amputation knife]] from the medical tools and attempts to stab Bond with it. He tries to lunge over the operating table to stab him, but but misses and Bond slams the surgical lights on him, stunning him for a moment.\n\nBond hoists Blofeld over the operating table, tying him up and showing him into a pool of steaming hot mud. Blofeld's body sinks in and Bond cranks the pool's heat further and wryly quips \"Welcome to Hell, Blofeld\", seemingly killing his archnemesis for good. This prompts [[Blofeld's cat]] to meow, cueing in the opening credits.\n\n===Search for the diamond smugglers===\n[[File:Diamonds are Forever - Wint and Kidd kill the dentist.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mr. Wint putting a scorpion inside Dr. Tynan's shirt, while the latter is occupied with checking Mr. Kidd's teeth.]]\nMeanwhile, huge quantities of South African [[diamonds]] are being stolen but have not been sold on the market. Suspecting that the gemstones are being stockpiled to depress prices or blackmail the mining corporation, [[M (Bernard Lee)|M]] orders Bond to assure the identity of a professional diamond smuggler called [[Peter Franks]] to infiltrate the smuggling operation and find out who the stockpilers are. Meanwhile every link in the diamond smuggling pipeline are being systematically executed by [[Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover)|Mr. Wint]] and [[Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith)|Mr. Kidd]] once they have done their job.\n\n[[File:Bondwiki Bond vs Franks elevator1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bond and Franks' intense fight in the elevator.]]\nBond travels to Amsterdam to meet with Franks' contact [[Tiffany Case (Jill St. John)|Tiffany Case]], who verifies his identity (Bond is wearing fake fingerprints supplied by [[Q (Desmond Llewelyn)|Q]]), but his cover is almost blown when the real Franks escapes capture and turns up at Tiffany's apartment. Bond intercepts Franks and kills him. Bond switches his wallet with that of Franks to continue the ruse to Tiffany that he is Franks, and suggest that they smuggle the diamonds to [[Las Vegas]] inside Franks' corpse. The pair board a flight to [[United States|America]], but are unaware that Wint and Kidd are on the same aircraft following them.\n\n===Arrival to Las Vegas===\n[[File:MrWintAndMrKiddBurningTheCoffin.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Mr. Wint & Mr. Kidd trapping Bond inside a coffin, which is going inside a furnace.]]\nUpon arrival, Bond is met by [[Felix Leiter (Norman Burton)|Felix Leiter]] who reveals that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] are also investigating the case. Bond accompanies Franks' corpse to Slumber Inc. - a funeral home in Las Vegas where it is cremated and the [[diamonds]] extracted. However, upon collecting Franks' $50,000 payout for the diamond smuggling, Bond is knocked out by Wint and Kidd, who then seal him in a coffin and attempt to incinerate him alive in the crematorium furnace. \n\nHe is rescued in the nick of time by [[Shady Tree (Leonard Barr)|Shady Tree]], the next link in the \"pipeline\" who discovered the diamonds inside Franks' body were fakes planted by Bond and the CIA. Bond (still posing as Franks) concludes the money must also have been fake if they were willing for it to burn with him in the crematorium and refuses to deliver the real diamonds until he is paid.\n\n[[File:Roulette Diamonds.jpg|thumb|left|250px|James Bond and Plenty O'Toole at the roulette table.]]\nBond tails Shady Tree to [[Lincoln Lounge]] - a casino hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire [[Willard Whyte]], where he works as a stand up comedian. Tree is executed by Wint and Kidd, but are told too late by casino manager and Whyte's right-hand man [[Bert Saxby]] that Franks had double crossed them and they still don't have the real diamonds. \n\nOn the casino floor, Bond meets the opportunistic [[Plenty O'Toole]] and uses the fake money from the funeral home as collateral in a craps game and wins $50,000 which is the real payout for the diamond smuggling. He takes Plenty back to his hotel room, but a mob of gangsters are already there and throw Plenty out the window with the intention of killing her (but she falls in a swimming pool and survives). Tiffany reappears, and demands that Bond (as Franks) delivers the diamonds. \n\n[[File:Bondwiki DAF71 Bond Leiter CIA Circus Circus1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bond, Leiter and other CIA agents observing Tiffany Case's movements at the Circus Circus.]]\nThey both agree to try and escape Las Vegas with the diamonds instead of delivering them, and instructs her to go to the [[Circus Circus]] casino to collect them, knowing that the CIA are watching her every move. \n\nTiffany shakes off the CIA agents and betrays Bond, delivering the diamonds to the next link in the \"pipeline\", but returns  home to discover that Plenty O'Toole has been drowned in her swimming pool by Wint and Kidd - having mistaken Plenty for her. Now realizing her own life is in danger, she joins forces with Bond to follow the diamonds to the next link.\n\n===W Tectronics===\n[[File:Bondwiki DAF71 Bond Metz Lab1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bond (posing as Klaus Hergersheimer) pestering Prof. Metz at his lab.]]\nBond and Tiffany witness the pick-up of the [[diamonds]] by [[Professor Dr. Metz]], and follow him to a remote desert research facility owned by Willard Whyte. Bond infiltrates the base, and poses as a [[Klaus Hergersheimer|lab technician]] - discovering that  Metz is constructing a [[Diamond Satellite|Laser Satellite]] which uses the diamonds to intensify its beam, making it able to hit a target on Earth from outer space. \n\n[[File:Bondwiki DAF71 W Tectronics MoonBuggy escape1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bond - driving the Moon Buggy - escaping the W Tectronics R&D.]]\nAfter being detected by the guards, Bond escapes in a moon buggy and evades Whyte's security forces in a desert chase. During the chase, Bond crashes the moon buggy, with a guard riding a Honda ATC 90 arriving to the scene. Bond knocks the guard off the ATC and hops on it, driving it towards the site perimeters. Subsequently, Bond finds Tiffany waiting by her Ford Mustang, with Bond abandoning the ATC and getting into Tiffany's car.\n\n===Las Vegas Strip and Whyte House===\nHe and Tiffany return to Las Vegas, and after evading the police a second time in another car chase through The Strip, they return to the Whyte House. \n\n[[File:Bondwiki DAF71 Two Blofelds.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bond baffled by the two Blofelds.]]\nBond ascends to, and then breaks into the penthouse to confront Willard Whyte, but finds the occupant is really [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld (classic film continuity)|Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] posing as Whyte (whom he has kidnapped) and is using his business empire as a front for his latest scheme. \n\nBlofeld only gives cryptic clues as to his intentions with the [[diamonds]], and despite Bond killing yet another one of his doubles, he spares him - sending him away in an elevator, where he is gassed and then buried in a desert pipe and left to die by Wint and Kidd. \n\nBond escapes by short circuiting a pipe welding machine.\n\n===Rescue of Whyte===\n[[File:Bondwiki Bond attacked by Bambi and Thumper.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bond getting double-teamed by Bambi and Thumper.]]\nWith the CIA's help, Bond tracks down and frees the kidnapped Willard Whyte after overcoming his female guards [[Bambi]] and [[Thumper]] and saves him from an assassination attempt by Saxby - who is shot dead by the CIA agents. Whyte reveals he has no knowledge of ever employing Metz or of the satellite being developed by his company. \n\n[[File:Diamond satellite (Diamonds are Forever).png|thumb|left|250px|Blofeld's Diamond Satellite begins its attack on superpowers' nuclear arsenals.]]\nShortly afterwards, the satellite is launched and starts to selectively destroy nuclear installations in America, [[Russia]] and [[China]], The group return to the Whyte House in search of Blofeld to find that he has fled, and has captured Tiffany in the process. \n\nIt is later revealed that he is holding the world to ransom, with nuclear supremacy going to the highest bidder, and he threatens to destroy a major city with the space weapon if his demands are not met. Whyte directs Bond to an [[W.W. Petroleum oil platform|oil platform]] off the coast of Baja California as the likely location of the ground base controlling the satellite.\n\n===Blofeld's Oil Rig===\n[[File:BlofeldExplainingHisPlansToJBond-DAF.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Blofeld explaining his scheme to Bond.]]\nBond travels to the oil platform with a team of covert CIA forces by helicopter, with the intention of sabotaging the computer controlling the satellite. After being captured by Blofeld, he discovers that Washington D.C is the city to be targeted. Bond escapes and sends a signal to the helicopters to begin attacking the base. \n\nAmid the confusion, Tiffany tries and fails to put a false control tape into the computer, but as the base is being battered by mortar fire form the helicopters and his security forces being overcome, Blofeld attempts to escape in his [[Bathosub|Bath-o-Sub]]. \n\nWith time rapidly running out and the satellite bearing down on Washington, Bond commandeers the crane lowering the sub into the water and instead uses it as a wrecking ball to destroy the control center for the satellite moments before it was due to fire.\n\n===Epilogue===\n[[File:Bondwiki DAF71 Bond Tiffany Wint Kidd Ship.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Wint & Kidd bringing the banquet to Bond and Tiffany.]]\nWith Blofeld's scheme foiled (and his fate remaining unclear), Bond and Tiffany set sail for [[London]] on a cruise ship. Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd are however still at large and also on the vessel. \n\nLater that evening, the two assassins pose as waiters delivering a banquet, whilst secretly hiding a bomb inside a cake -- \"[[La Bombe Surprise]]\". Bond catches a wiff of Wint's aftershave - connecting it to the smell during the pipe burial escapade - and begins to slowly set up traps to see if the two are real waiters. After exposing their etiquette mistakes and the aftershave smell, the two assassins know the jig is up and attack Bond.\n\nWint incapacitates Bond with a necklace chain, while Kidd gets burning shish-kebab skewers to stab Bond with. However, Bond breaks a bottle of alcohol open and throws its contents at Kidd, which, upon contact with the burning skewers, sets him on fire. Kidd is forced to jump overboard, with Bond overpowering Wint, revealing the bomb inside the cake. \n\n[[File:JBondTCaseEndingScene.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Bond and Tiffany embracing at the end.]]\nBond traps Wint and attaches the bomb onto him, throwing the second assassin overboard. Wint lands in the water and explodes, killing both assassins. Bond and Tiffany embrace, and look up at the night sky. They muse over how the [[diamonds]] could ever be retrieved from the satellite, which is still orbiting the [[Earth]].",

Broccoli|Albert Broccoli]] indeed had a dream, where his close friend Howard Hughes was replaced by an imposter and talked about it to Maibaum<ref name=\"Scripting007\" />. One of the other changes decided was to abandon the Southeast Asia locations to replace them by Las Vegas, like in the novel. A boat chase on Lake Mead was notably a part of it, as the western town of the novel and its locomotive<ref name=\"Scripting007\" />.\n\nScreenwriter [[Tom Mankiewicz]] was chosen to rework Maibaum's script. Mankiewicz says he was hired because Broccoli wanted an American writer to work on the script, since so much of it was set in Las Vegas \"and the Brits write really lousy American gangsters\" – but it had to be someone who also understood the British idiom, since it had British characters<ref name=\"MankiewiczBio\">{{cite book|last1=Mankiewicz|first1=Tom|author-link1=Tom Mankiewicz|last2=Crane|first2=Robert|title=My Life as a Mankiewicz|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|location=Lexington, KY|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8131-3605-9}}</ref>. David Picker, then-president of United Artists, had seen the stage musical ''Georgy'' written by Mankiewicz, and recommended him; he was hired on a two-week trial and kept on for the rest of the movie, as well as several subsequent Bond films<ref name=\"MankiewiczBio\" />. During his presence, the moon-buggy chase and the car chase with the police were added, and the final was changed to an oil-rig assault<ref name=\"Scripting007\" /><ref name=\"Starlog\" />.\n\nOriginally the oil rig finale also had Blofeld escape from the rig in his mini submarine, pursued by Bond who would hang from a weather balloon<ref name=\"Scripting007\" />. Bond would eventually catch up to his nemesis in a salt mine where the two would finally fight to the death, with Blofeld killed by Bond<ref name=\"Scripting007\" />. The elimination of this entire sequence, and indeed of any death scene for Blofeld, leaves a major plothole in the film, as Blofeld simply disappears without explanation.\n\nScreenwriters Stanley Price and Ronald Hardy also did some uncredited rewrites<ref name=\"Scripting007\" />.\n\nIn the end, the plot of the novel ''Diamonds Are Forever'' is very little used, with the exception of a few characters and a few scenes, including the one where Wint and Kidd try to kill Bond and Tiffany Case on a cruise ship.

However, the producers were unhappy with this decision due to their experience with the similarly unknown Lazenby in the previous film, and when [[Sean Connery]] made it known that he would be interested in returning, Gavin's contract was quietly bought out.\n\nWhen first approached about resuming the role of Bond, Sean Connery half-jokingly demanded the astronomical fee of £2m ($4m or over $20m in 2005) and a production deal. Both demands were met and Connery used part of the fee to establish a charity to help deprived children in Edinburgh.\n\nConnery's final scene to be filmed - his last in an official EON produced Bond film - was the crematorium sequence. Somewhat fittingly, it was shot on Friday 13th, 1971.\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nScenes also cut from the theatrical release include Plenty O' Toole sneaking back into Bond's hotel room and searching through Tiffany Case's purse, and Plenty breaking into Tiffany's house.",

    "Trivia": "*In the first scene, the man that is being attacked by Bond speaks without moving his mouth in any way, suggesting that the voice over was dubbed on top after recording, or the man in question wasn't intended to have any lines.\n*''Diamonds Are Forever'' contains shortest post-gunbarrel moment of peace in a James Bond film. The distance between the white dot revelation and a subsequent clash of chaos is around 10 seconds; it shows a quiet, seemingly tranquil Japanese living room (with appropriate background music) being intruded and crashed by a criminal - possibly a SPECTRE agent - who gets bashed up by Bond who violently demands the information of Blofeld's whereabouts.\n*This is the first Bond film where the film's title is never mentioned even once other than during the theme song.\n*No reference is made to [[Tracy Bond]] at all throughout the film, despite her death immediately prior being such an important moment in Bond's life. In fact, owing the film's opening scene taking place in Japan, it has been suggested by some that ''Diamonds Are Forever'' is actually intended as a direct sequel to ''You Only Live Twice'', completely ignoring the events of ''On her Majesty's Secret Service''. However, the presence of Bond's [[Aston Martin DBS]] in Q's lab appears to contradict this theory, plus Bond's rough handling of the people he interrogrates suggest he is engaging in revenge against Blofeld (although once again no reference is made to this later in the film when Bond again encounters Blofeld). The reference to Bond having been on vacation might suggest his pursuit of Blofeld was unauthorized, which may explain M's somewhat cold attitude towards Bond after the mission. Fans would have to wait until ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' for the first post-OHMSS reference to Tracy.\n*In his final scene as James Bond in his last ever EON Bond film, Sean Connery was seen wearing a black dinner suit with blue shirt. Back when he played the 007 agent for the first time in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', he was firstly seen wearing a standard black-and-white tuxedo in the famous \"Bond, James Bond\" scene. This made Connery the first Bond who wears tuxedo in both his first and last ever scenes as 007.\n*As was the case with OHMSS, an actor very different from his predecessor was cast as Blofeld. This is in keeping with how Fleming depicted Blofeld in his novels as frequently changing his appearance and even demeanour. The fact his scheming includes using plastic surgery to create doubles of himself further explains his change of appearance (which, among other things, included restoring his earlobes that had been removed as part of his scheme in OHMSS). The film avoids the question of whether the real Blofeld is apparently killed by Bond at the end or another double; when a Blofeld-like character (assumed to be the original) appears in the opening sequence of ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', his poor physical condition would suggest he is the same individual seen in this film. \n*The exterior for the Whyte House Hotel is the Las Vegas Hilton (then called the Las Vegas International Hotel).\n*The Lufthansa flight that carries Bond and Tiffany, Wint and Kidd from Frankfurt to Los Angeles was LH450. To the present day (2019) this same flight number and route is still operated by Lufthansa.\n*Two villains in the [[w:c:cartoonnetwork|Cartoon Network]]'s animated series ''Codename: Kids Next Door'', ''Mr. Fibb'' and ''Mr. Wink'', are spoofs of Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint.\n*Sammy Davis Jr.'s brief cameo appearance was cut from the theatrical release. It would later be restored on the DVD. The scene has Davis and Saxby ridiculing Bond's decision to wear a tuxedo to a Vegas casino, an indication of how standards in Vegas differed from European casinos (Bond wears a tux when visiting a European casino in ''[[The World Is Not Enough (film)|The World is Not Enough]]'', for example.) Davis still appears in the final film, however: his photograph and name are prominently visible on the opposite page of a newspaper advertisement for Shady Tree's show.\n*The woman in the bikini named \"Marie\", who was in the beginning of the film who Bond \"convinced\" to give up the location of Blofeld was Denise Perrier, Miss World 1953.\n*The man who drowns in the mudbath was played by stuntman Max Latimer. The mud was actually bucketloads of mashed potatoes. Latimer had to hold his breath as he submerged under the substance each time. As the studio lamps were very hot, the mashed potato mixture started to cook due to the filming taking a long time, by the end of which it started to smell horrible.\n*Jay Sarno, owner of the circus seen in this film, insisted that he be allowed to display the scene featuring the [[Zambora]] attraction, in exchange for letting them use his circus as a set. He also plays a [[Unnamed Scientist|minor role]] in the film.\n*Beginning with ''Diamonds are Forever'' and ending with ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'', the franchise would alternate from film-to-film between being scored by [[John Barry]] or other composers.\n*The fate of the three people Bond interrogates during the teaser is left ambiguous, with Marie in particular left in the process of being choked by Bond. Whether he lets them go or uses his licence to kill in order to prevent Blofeld from being forewarned is left unconfirmed.\n*The Las Vegas sequences are a time capsule of the city as it was in 1971, referencing numerous Vegas locations, some of which no longer exist (Bond references the Tropicana - demolished in 2024 - and during the Fremont Street chase, the then-under-construction Union Plaza hotel towers over the scene, complete with visible \"opening soon\" sign; the Circus Circus resort is still operational in 2024 though its current fairground attractions differ from those featured).\n*One scene often cited as an example of unnecessary comic relief shows an elephant walking through a casino and playing a slot machine. In fact, this was a real animal performer at Circus Circus named Tanya who was known for doing exactly that.",
